- Doesn't want monthly fees eating into profits before making sales

**Time Pains:**
- Limited hours after work, can't afford to spend months learning
- Every tutorial leads to another tutorial, never actually builds
- Weekends disappear into research, no progress

**Tech Pains:**
- Doesn't know DNS, hosting, SSL - these words mean nothing
- Tried Shopify, felt like learning a new language
- Scared of breaking something and not knowing how to fix it

**Knowledge Pains:**
- Doesn't know the RIGHT order to do things
- Conflicting advice everywhere (start with product? start with store? start with audience?)
- Analysis paralysis - researches endlessly, launches never

## False Solutions He's Been Sold

- "Just start a Shopify store, it's easy" → Tried, wasn't easy for him
- "Watch YouTube tutorials" → 50 hours in, still hasn't launched
- "Start dropshipping, it's passive income" → Realized it's not passive at all
- "You need to validate your idea first" → Validated to death, still no store

---

## Mistaken Beliefs

- "I need to understand everything before I can start"
- "Other people are just smarter at tech than me"
- "I probably need more money before I can really launch"
- "I should wait until I have more time"
- "Real businesses need custom development"

---

## Goals

**Secondary Goal**: Prove to himself (and others) he can actually do this

**Hidden Goal**: Escape the 9-5 eventually

## Values

- Guidance (wants to be told what to do)
- Value for money (limited budget, needs ROI)
- Legitimacy (wants to look like a real business)

| "Is this actually easy or are you just saying that?" | Been told things are easy before, they weren't |

| "What's the catch?" | Skeptical of good deals |

---

## Expensive Alternatives He's Considered

| Alternative | Why He Rejected It |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Shopify | Monthly fees scared him, plus apps add up |

| Waiting until he has more money | Been waiting 2 years already |

## Relatable Stories

**Story 1 - The Endless Research Loop**:
Marcus spent 6 months watching YouTube videos about starting an online store. Every video led to another video. He had 47 browser tabs open, 3 half-finished courses, and zero sales. His girlfriend started joking "how's the store going?" and he'd change the subject.

**Story 2 - The Shopify Trial Disaster**:
He finally started a Shopify free trial. Day 1: Excited. Day 3: Confused by themes. Day 7: Overwhelmed by apps. Day 14: Trial expired, store was 20% done, cancelled and felt like a failure.

**Story 3 - The Friend Who Launched**:
His buddy Jake launched a store and made his first sale within a month. Marcus asked how. Jake said "I just... did it." Marcus realized he was overthinking everything but still couldn't get unstuck.

## Voice Line (What Marcus Would Say)

> "I've been 'about to launch' for a year. I've watched every tutorial. I know the theory. I just... can't seem to actually do it. Every time I start, I get lost in settings and options and decisions. I just want someone to show me exactly what to do, step by step, and actually get this thing live."
