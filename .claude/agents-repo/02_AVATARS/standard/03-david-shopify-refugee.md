## Emotion Analysis

| Emotion | Trigger | Can We Solve? | Story Potential | Strength |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Frustration** | Watching $500+/month go to Shopify + apps for basic features | YES | YES | **STRONG** |
| Anger | Feels trapped - invested too much to leave easily | YES | YES | Strong |
| Fear | What if migration breaks everything? | YES | YES | Medium |
| Calculation | Always running numbers, knows exactly what he's losing | YES | YES | Strong |
| Independence | Wants to OWN his platform, not rent it | YES | YES | Strong |

**Primary Emotion to Leverage**: FRUSTRATION + CALCULATION → OWNERSHIP + SAVINGS

---

## Pain Points

**Money Pains:**
- Shopify: $79-299/month base
- Apps: Reviews ($15), Email ($50), Upsells ($30), Subscriptions ($100), etc.
- Total: $400-700/month JUST to run the store
- That's $5K-8K/year to RENT his own business

**Platform Pains:**
- Doesn't own his customer data (not really)
- Shopify could change terms anytime
- App ecosystem is extortion - basic features cost extra
- Locked into their payment processor rates

**Scaling Pains:**
- The more he sells, the more Shopify takes
- Enterprise tier is even more expensive
- Custom features require expensive Shopify developers

**Migration Pains:**
- Afraid of losing SEO during migration
- Customer data export is messy
- Don't want downtime during switch

---

## False Solutions He's Been Sold

- "Shopify is worth it for the ecosystem" → Ecosystem = paying 15 apps
- "BigCommerce has lower fees" → Looked into it, still significant
- "Just raise prices to cover platform costs" → Competitor pressure limits this
- "WooCommerce is free" → Heard horror stories about maintenance

---

## Mistaken Beliefs

- "Migrating will be a nightmare that takes months"
- "I'll lose my Google rankings if I switch"
- "Only enterprise companies can afford to own their platform"
- "Better the devil you know"
- "Custom means starting from scratch"

---

## Goals

**Primary Goal**: Stop paying rent on his own business - own the platform outright

**Secondary Goal**: Reduce operational costs, improve margins

**Hidden Goal**: Build an asset he can eventually sell (owned platform = higher multiple)

---

## Values

- Ownership (it's HIS business, should be HIS platform)
- Profitability (every dollar to Shopify is a dollar not in his pocket)
- Independence (hates being locked in)
- Long-term thinking (building an asset, not renting one)

---

## Objections

| Objection | Root Fear |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Will this handle my traffic/sales volume?" | Worried about performance at scale |
| "What about my apps - reviews, email, etc.?" | Dependent on ecosystem |
| "How hard is migration?" | Fears losing data, rankings, sales |
| "What if I need features you don't have?" | Worried about limitations |
| "Is the code quality enterprise-grade?" | Doesn't want amateur tech |

---

## Expensive Alternatives He's Considered

| Alternative | Why He Rejected/Considering |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Stay on Shopify | Default, but bleeding money |
| BigCommerce | Same model, different logo |
| Custom Development | $30K-60K quotes, 4-6 month timeline |
| Magento/Adobe Commerce | Enterprise complexity, needs dedicated dev |
| WooCommerce | Maintenance concerns, plugin conflicts |

---

## The Math He's Done

```
Current Shopify Costs (Annual):
- Shopify Plan: $299/mo = $3,588
- Apps (conservative): $350/mo = $4,200
- Transaction fees (on $300K revenue): ~$6,000
- TOTAL: $13,788/year

Store + App Launch Kit:
- One-time: $297
- Hosting (self): ~$50/mo = $600/year
- TOTAL Year 1: $897
- TOTAL Year 2+: $600/year

10-Year Savings: $130,000+
```

## Relatable Stories

**Story 1 - The App Audit Rage**:
David sat down to audit his Shopify apps. He had 23 installed. He was paying for: reviews ($15), email popups ($29), upsells ($49), subscriptions ($99), loyalty ($59), bundles ($35)... He added it up: $487/month in APPS. For features that should be built-in. He didn't sleep well that night.

**Story 2 - The Price Increase Email**:
Shopify announced another price increase. David did the math on 3 years of "small" increases. He'd gone from $79/month base to $299. Plus app inflation. He was paying 4x what he started with, for the same features.

**Story 3 - The Exit Multiple Conversation**:
David talked to a broker about selling his business. Broker asked: "Do you own the platform or is it on Shopify?" When David said Shopify, broker said "that affects the multiple - you're selling a business dependent on a third party." David started researching alternatives that week.

## Voice Line (What David Would Say)

> "I'm paying over $500 a month just to run my store. Not for ads. Not for products. Just to keep the lights on. Shopify plus 15 apps for features that should be standard. I've done the math - that's $60K over 10 years to RENT my own business. I want to own my platform, but I can't afford $50K for custom development and I can't afford months of migration headaches. There has to be a middle ground."

## How Store + App Launch Kit Solves His Pain

| His Pain | Our Solution |

| Doesn't own platform | Full source code, it's yours |
| Migration fears | Clean migration path, we help |
| Custom dev too expensive | Pre-built but customizable |
| Worried about scale | Handles real traffic, proven |

## Ad Angles That Work for David

1. **"How much did you pay Shopify last year? What if that was the last payment?"** - math hook
2. **"Shopify's fees built Shopify. Your fees should build YOUR business."** - ownership angle
3. **"I calculated my 10-year Shopify cost. Then I found this."** - story + math
4. **"Own your store or rent it forever. Your choice."** - binary frame
5. **"$500/month to run your store? There's another way."** - direct pain
6. **"What Shopify doesn't want you to know about owning your platform"** - curiosity + enemy
