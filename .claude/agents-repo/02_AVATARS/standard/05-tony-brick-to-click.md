## Relatable Stories

**Story 1 - The Web Guy Disaster**:
Tony hired a local "web developer" for $3,000. Guy took 4 months. Delivered a site Tony couldn't update. When Tony called with questions, guy took days to respond. Then stopped responding entirely. Tony still has the site - it shows products from 3 years ago. He's too embarrassed to send customers to it.

**Story 2 - The Customer Walk-Out**:
A customer spent 20 minutes looking at products, then said "I'll just order this on Amazon." Tony didn't have an online option. The customer walked out. This happens 2-3 times a week now. He adds up the lost sales: $2K+ per month walking out the door.

**Story 3 - The Competitor's Website**:
His competitor across town got a website. Now Tony's old customers are buying from them - they can browse online, see inventory, and order for delivery. Tony overheard a customer say "Tony's place doesn't have a website? That's weird." It stung.

## Voice Line (What Tony Would Say)

> "I've run this store for 22 years. I know my products, I know my customers. But this online stuff... I don't know where to start. I hired a web guy once - waste of money. I don't speak 'tech.' I just need someone to help me get online without making me feel stupid. Something simple that works, with a real person I can call if something breaks."
