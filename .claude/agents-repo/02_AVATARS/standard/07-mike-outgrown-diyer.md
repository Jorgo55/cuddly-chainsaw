## False Solutions He's Been Sold

- "Upgrade to premium Wix" → Still limited
- "Add more plugins/apps" → Creates Frankenstein monster
- "Shopify solves everything" → At $500+/month with all needed apps
- "Just make it work" → He has been, for 2 years

---

## Mistaken Beliefs

- "Custom development is the only way to get these features"
- "Real ecommerce platforms cost $500+/month"
- "Migration will break everything"
- "I'll lose my SEO if I switch"
- "My current site is 'good enough' for now"

---

## Goals

**Primary Goal**: Upgrade to a platform that can handle real growth without limitations

**Secondary Goal**: Stop wasting time on workarounds, focus on actual business growth

**Hidden Goal**: Have a site he's proud to show people

---

## Values

- Functionality (needs features that work)
- Efficiency (time spent on workarounds is wasted)
- Growth (platform should enable, not limit)
- Value (doesn't want to overpay for basics)

---

## Objections

| Objection | Root Fear |
|-----------|-----------|
| "What about my existing products/content?" | Migration hassle |
| "Will this actually have the features I need?" | Trading one limitation for another |
| "What about SEO/redirects?" | Losing rankings |
| "Is this a real upgrade or a lateral move?" | Wasting time/money |

---

## Expensive Alternatives He's Considered

| Alternative | Why He Rejected/Hesitated |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Shopify + apps | Did the math: $79 + apps = $400+/month |
| Custom development | $15K-40K quotes, 3-6 month timeline |
| BigCommerce | Similar to Shopify in cost structure |
| Staying put | Knows it's limiting growth |

## Relatable Stories

**Story 1 - The Feature Request That Broke Him**:
A customer asked "can I subscribe for monthly delivery?" Mike said "not yet." He spent 6 hours researching how to add subscriptions to Wix. There was no good solution. He lost the customer. He lost 4 more customers that month asking the same thing.

**Story 2 - The Competitor Site**:
Mike looked at his competitor's website. Clean. Fast. Mobile app. Subscription options. Customer accounts. Mike looked at his Wix site. It looked like a website from 2018. Same products, but his competitor looked like a real brand and Mike looked like a hobby.

**Story 3 - The Developer Quote**:
Mike finally called a dev agency. "We can build what you need for $28,000. Timeline: 4 months." Mike's stomach dropped. He couldn't justify $28K. But he couldn't keep running on Wix. He felt stuck between too expensive and not good enough.

## Voice Line (What Mike Would Say)

> "I built my site on Wix two years ago. It was fine then. Now I'm doing $8K/month and the platform can't keep up. I can't do subscriptions. I can't do proper inventory. My site is slow. I've looked at Shopify but the monthly cost with all the apps I'd need is insane. I got a custom dev quote - $28K. I just need something in between - more than Wix, less than custom, without bleeding $500/month forever."
