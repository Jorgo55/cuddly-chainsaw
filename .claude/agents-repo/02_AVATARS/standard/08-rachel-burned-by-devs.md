- Projects dragged for 6-12 months
- Endless "it's almost done" emails

- Embarrassed to tell people what happened
- Angry at herself and the devs
- Hesitant to try again, but knows she needs to

## False Solutions She's Been Sold (And Burned By)

- "We'll build your custom store for $5K" → Took $5K, delivered garbage
- "We're a full-service agency" → Couldn't deliver basics
- "We specialize in ecommerce" → Clearly didn't
- "We'll have it done in 6 weeks" → 6 months later, still broken
- "Trust us, we've done this before" → Portfolio was fake/exaggerated

---

## Mistaken Beliefs

- "Everyone in this space is probably a scammer"
- "If it sounds good, there's a catch"
- "I need to hire someone, I can't do this myself"
- "Maybe I'm just not meant to have an online business"
- "Cheap = scam, but I can't afford expensive anymore"

---

## Goals

**Primary Goal**: Finally get a working online store without getting burned again

**Secondary Goal**: Rebuild confidence in her ability to make this happen

**Hidden Goal**: Prove to herself (and others) that she can succeed despite past failures

---

## Values

- Proof (show me, don't tell me)
- Transparency (no hidden fees, no surprises)
- Guarantee (reduce her risk)
- Track record (real testimonials, verifiable)
- Support (someone who actually responds)

---

## Objections

| Objection | Root Fear |
|-----------|-----------|
| "How do I know this isn't another scam?" | Been burned multiple times |
| "What if I can't get support when I need it?" | Devs disappeared before |
| "Is there a money-back guarantee?" | Needs risk reversal |
| "Can I talk to real customers who used this?" | Needs social proof |
| "What's the catch?" | Assumes there's always a catch |

---

## Expensive Alternatives She's Tried

| Alternative | Her Experience |
|-------------|---------------|
| Dev Agency | $8K, 6 months, incomplete project, they ghosted |
| Freelancer (Upwork) | $3K, delivered broken code, no support |
| "Friend's nephew who does websites" | $2K, amateur results, can't maintain |
| Another agency | $5K "rescue project" fee, still didn't work |
| TOTAL WASTED: $14K-20K+ |

## Her Horror Story

Rachel wanted a multi-vendor marketplace. She hired a dev agency that said they specialized in ecommerce. They quoted $8,000. She paid 50% upfront.

Month 1: "Making great progress!"
Month 2: "Just fixing a few bugs."
Month 3: "Almost there, just need another $2K for unexpected features."
Month 4: She paid the extra $2K.
Month 5: "Few more weeks."
Month 6: They stopped responding to emails.

She got a lawyer involved. They were overseas. Nothing she could do.

She tried Upwork next. Cheaper dev, $3K. He delivered something that looked okay but broke constantly. He vanished after "finishing."

Two years. $14K+. No working store.

## Relatable Stories

**Story 1 - The Ghost**:
Rachel hired an agency with great reviews. They were responsive for 2 months. Then slower. Then once a week. Then nothing. She sent 47 emails. Made 23 calls. Nothing. $8,000 gone. She cried in her car in the parking lot of her office.

**Story 2 - The Rescue Scam**:
After the first agency ghosted, she found another that offered "rescue projects." They charged $5K to "fix" the broken code. They worked for 3 weeks. Declared it "unfixable." Recommended starting over. For another $10K. She said no. They shrugged.

**Story 3 - The Confession**:
At a business owner meetup, Rachel heard herself say "I've spent $14,000 on my website and I still don't have one." The room went quiet. Someone said "that's insane." She felt sick. She'd never said the number out loud before.

## Voice Line (What Rachel Would Say)

> "I've been burned. Badly. I paid a dev agency $8K and they ghosted me. I paid a freelancer $3K and he delivered garbage. I've spent over $14,000 trying to get an online store and I STILL don't have one. Now I don't trust anyone. But I still need a solution. I just need someone to prove they're not going to screw me over. Show me it works. Give me a guarantee. Let me talk to real people who've used it. I can't afford to lose more money OR more time."
