# Offer Creation System

Complete framework for building irresistible offers. Based on Jack Rogers' methodology.

## The Value Equation (Core Framework)

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**To maximize value, you must:**
- INCREASE Dream Outcome
- INCREASE Perceived Likelihood
- DECREASE Time Delay
- DECREASE Effort & Sacrifice

### Dream Outcome (DO)
The measurable outcome the buyer wants.
- Must be **specific** (who, what, timeframe)
- Vague outcomes reduce perceived likelihood
- Example: "100 clients per month" > "more clients"

### Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (PLA)
How likely they believe they'll succeed.

Increase with:
- Testimonials
- Case studies
- Results (screenshots/metrics with context)

**PLA Rule:** Proof must be **contexted** (who it worked for + timeframe + constraints)

### Time Delay (TD)
How long until they see results.

Reduce with:
- "Quickstart" steps (early wins)
- Clear timeframe to first improvement
- Faster milestones within longer programs

### Effort & Sacrifice (E&S)
How much work/pain is required.

Reduce with:
- Step-by-step instruction
- Templates / swipe files / checklists
- "Time saving" emphasis
- Clear "what to do next" sequencing

## Default Message Flow

Use this sequence for ads/landing pages:

1. **Hook** - Pattern interrupt + self-identification
2. **Jealousy / Contrast** - Show what's possible (others achieving)
3. **Dig into the Problem** - Agitate current pain
4. **Present Product as Solution** - Introduce mechanism
5. **Easy / Quick / Safe Framing** - Reduce TD and E&S
6. **Objection Handling** - Address concerns
7. **Social Proof** - Testimonials / case studies / results
8. **CTA** - One clean action

## What An Irresistible Offer Is NOT

These are expected basics - they won't make your offer irresistible:

| ❌ Not Differentiating | Why |
|------------------------|-----|
| Outstanding customer service | Expected as standard |
| Amazing quality | Everyone claims this |
| Having a great team | Assumed, not compelling |
| Great reputation | Supports offer, doesn't define it |
| Free shipping | Common expectation |
| Biggest range at best prices | Not unique |
| "We've been in business since 1979" | Customers care about NOW |

**What DOES make an offer irresistible:**
- Unique elements that provide exceptional value
- Urgency (real, time-based)
- A clear, compelling reason to act NOW

## Claim Safety Rules

When making claims in offers:

| Proof Level | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **PROVEN** | Proof provided → use claim |
| **PLAUSIBLE** | No proof → soften language |
| **RISKY** | Implies guaranteed outcomes → rewrite |

**Rewrite examples:**
- "instant success" → "faster wins" / "shorten the learning curve"
- "average positive return in 7 days" → "many clients report early positive signals within ~7 days (varies)"

Every offer element serves this.
