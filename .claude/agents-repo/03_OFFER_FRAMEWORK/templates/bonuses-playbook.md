8 rules for creating high-converting bonuses.

---

## Rule 1: Bonuses Should Be FREE and More Valuable Than Core

Making bonuses more valuable than the core offering increases perceived value and makes the decision to buy easier.

**Question:** Does your bonus stack appear more valuable than what they're paying for?

**Core Offer Value:** $___
**Total Bonus Value:** $___

Bonus value should exceed core value (or get close).

---

## Rule 2: Bonuses Should Solve All Perceived Problems

Bonuses should address every potential problem or objection the audience might have.

**List Objections:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Bonus That Solves Each:**

| Objection | Bonus to Address It |
|-----------|---------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

---

## Rule 3: Give Bonuses a Special Name With Benefit in Title

Names matter. Transform generic names into value-loaded names.

**Bad → Good Examples:**
- "Creative Swipe File" → "Our $200M Plug-and-Play Creatives"
- "Checklist" → "The 15-Point Launch Checklist That Saved Clients 40 Hours"
- "Templates" → "Done-For-You Templates Worth $2,000"

**Your Bonuses:**

| Generic Name | Value-Loaded Name |
|--------------|-------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

## Rule 4: Explain Bonus Details Clearly

Required structure for presenting each bonus:

1. **Relevance** - How it relates to their issue
2. **Description** - What it is
3. **Benefit** - What it will do for them
4. **Improvement** - How it makes their life faster/easier/less effort

**Bonus Presentation Template:**
```
[Bonus Name]

You're also getting [bonus] because I know that [relevance to their problem].

This is [description of what it is].

With this, you'll be able to [benefit - what it does for them].

Which means [improvement - faster/easier/less effort].
```

## Rule 5: Provide Proof for Each Bonus

Establish credibility for bonus value:

| Proof Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Statistics | "Used by 500+ clients" |
| Testimonials | "Here's what Sarah said..." |
| Personal Experience | "I used this exact template to..." |
| Results | "This checklist helped us save..." |

**Your Bonus Proof:**

| Bonus | Proof Statement |
|-------|-----------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

---

## Rule 6: Assign a Monetary Value and Justify It

Every bonus needs a dollar value.

**Value Assignment Template:**
```
Bonus 1: [Name]
- Normally: $[value]
- Today: FREE

Bonus 2: [Name]
- Normally: $[value]
- Today: FREE

Bonus 3: [Name]
- Normally: $[value]
- Today: FREE
```

**How to Justify Value:**
- What would it cost to create this?
- What would it cost to hire someone to do this?
- What results has it produced?
- What time does it save?

## Rule 7: Prioritize Bonuses With Immediate Value

Prefer bonuses that provide immediate, actionable value.

**Ranking by Immediacy:**

| High Immediacy (Best) | Medium | Low Immediacy |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------|
| Tools | Additional training | Courses |
| Checklists | Templates | Communities |
| Swipe files | Frameworks | Coaching calls |
| Quick-start guides | Worksheets | Long-form content |

**Your Bonus Immediacy Ranking:**
1. (Most immediate):
2.
3.
4. (Least immediate):

## Rule 8: Present Bonuses AFTER Stating the Price

**Timing Rule:** Introduce bonuses immediately after the price.

**Why:** Makes bonuses feel unexpected and increases perceived value.

**Structure:**
1. Present core offer
2. State the price
3. THEN reveal bonuses
4. Show total value vs price
