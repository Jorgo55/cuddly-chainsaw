# Power Guarantee Framework

Guarantees reduce perceived risk. By addressing concerns and lowering risk, a guarantee can increase conversions and support long-term customer relationships.

---

## Why Guarantees Work

Most businesses already provide some form of remedy when a customer is unhappy. The guarantee simply **advertises this promise upfront** to reduce perceived risk and increase action.

Common seller worries:
- "What if scammers take advantage?"
- "What if I go broke offering this?"

Reality: Most people are honest. Refund rates typically stay 5-15%. The increase in conversions usually far exceeds refund costs.
