## Value Principle: Speed Increases Value

The faster you can get your target market to the desired outcome, the better.

> A 60-minute back massage is less valuable than a 5-minute massage **if the outcome is the same**.

**Implication:** If you can deliver the same result faster, your offer is more valuable. Emphasize speed.
