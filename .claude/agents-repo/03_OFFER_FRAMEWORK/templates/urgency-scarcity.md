# Urgency & Scarcity Framework

Time-based and quantity-based mechanisms to increase action-taking.

---

## Definitions

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Urgency** | Time-based reason to act now | "Offer ends Friday" |
| **Scarcity** | Quantity-based limitation | "Only 10 spots left" |

Both must be **REAL** to maintain trust.

## Urgency Types

### 1. Group/Cohort Timing
Next round starts at specific time.
- "Next group starts Monday"
- "Cohort 7 begins March 1st"
- "Doors close Sunday at midnight"

### 2. Rolling/Deadline Urgency
Ongoing time windows.
- "48-hour flash sale"
- "This week only"
- "Ends when timer hits zero"

### 3. Seasonal Urgency
Tied to calendar events.
- "Summer special"
- "Back-to-school pricing"
- "Holiday hangover sale"
- "New year new you"

### 4. Price/Bonus Urgency
Value disappearing.
- "Price increases Monday"
- "Bonuses expire at midnight"
- "Early-bird pricing ends tomorrow"

### 5. Opportunity Urgency
Window closing naturally.
- "You can wait, but the opportunity gets smaller every second"
- "Your competitors are already doing this"
- "The longer you wait, the more [money/time/opportunity] you lose"

## Scarcity Types

### 1. Limited Seats/Units
- "Only 10 spots available"
- "Limited to 50 units"
- "First 20 customers only"

### 2. Capacity Constraints
- "Only accepting 5 clients this month"
- "I can only handle 3 new projects"
- "Limited by our team capacity"

### 3. Bonus Scarcity
- "First 50 get the bonus"
- "Limited supply on bonuses"
- "Bonus available for next 24 hours only"

### 4. Never Again (Use Sparingly)
- "This exact offer won't be repeated"
- "Retiring this package after this launch"
- **Must be TRUE - don't fake this**

## Luxury Scarcity Model (Louis Vuitton)

Reference pattern for believable scarcity:
- Only send 1-2 items to each store
- Stores don't know what's coming next
- Creates genuine rarity

**Application:** Use controlled, believable scarcity. Don't fake "only 3 left" if you have unlimited.

## Urgency/Scarcity Swipe Lines

**Urgency:**
- "Next group starts Monday"
- "Summer special ends [date]"
- "These bonuses are going away"
- "Price goes up to $X on [date]"
- "Only available during launch week"
- "Offer expires when timer hits zero"

**Scarcity:**
- "Only accepting X clients"
- "Limited to X spots"
- "First X people only"
- "Only X left in stock"
- "X seats remaining in this cohort"

**Combined:**
- "Only 10 spots at this price, and we start Monday"
- "First 20 get the bonus, offer ends Friday"

## Rules

1. **Must be REAL** - Fake scarcity destroys trust
2. **Must be SPECIFIC** - "Limited time" is weak; "ends Friday 11:59pm EST" is strong
3. **Must be EXPLAINED** - Why is it limited? (capacity, cohort, inventory, etc.)
