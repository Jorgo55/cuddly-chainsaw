# Value Equation Template

The core framework for maximizing offer value.

---

## The Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Goal:** Maximize numerator, minimize denominator.

---

## 1. Dream Outcome (DO) - MAXIMIZE

The measurable outcome the buyer wants.

**Current Dream Outcome:**
>

**Is it specific?** (who, what, timeframe)
- [ ] Yes - specific and measurable
- [ ] No - needs refinement

**Refined Dream Outcome:**
>

**Example transformations:**
- "More sales" → "Double your monthly revenue in 90 days"
- "Lose weight" → "Drop 2 dress sizes in 6 weeks"
- "Get clients" → "Book 10 qualified calls per week"

---

## 2. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (PLA) - MAXIMIZE

How likely they believe they'll achieve the dream outcome.

**Proof Assets Available:**

| Type | Details | Strength |
|------|---------|----------|
| Testimonials | | |
| Case Studies | | |
| Results/Screenshots | | |
| Data/Statistics | | |
| Before/After | | |
| Certifications | | |

**PLA Rule:** Proof must be contexted:
- WHO it worked for
- TIMEFRAME
- CONSTRAINTS/conditions

**Strongest Proof Statement:**
>

---

## 3. Time Delay (TD) - MINIMIZE

How long until they see results.

**Current Time to First Result:**

**Can we add quickstart wins?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**Quick Wins to Add:**
1.
2.
3.

**Time Delay Reducers:**
- [ ] First improvement milestone defined
- [ ] Early wins built into program
- [ ] Clear timeline communicated
- [ ] "Quickstart" step included

**New Time to First Result:**

---

## 4. Effort & Sacrifice (E&S) - MINIMIZE

How much work/pain required from the buyer.

**Current Effort Required:**

**E&S Reducers Available:**

| Reducer | Have It? | Details |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Step-by-step instructions | | |
| Templates | | |
| Swipe files | | |
| Checklists | | |
| Done-for-you elements | | |
| Automation | | |
| Support/guidance | | |

**Effort-Reducing Language:**
- [ ] "Time saving" emphasized
- [ ] "No experience needed" (if true)
- [ ] "Step-by-step" mentioned
- [ ] Clear "what to do next" sequencing
- [ ] Complexity removed/hidden

**New Perceived Effort:**

---

## Value Score

Rate each variable (1-10):

| Variable | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Dream Outcome (clarity + desirability) | /10 | |
| Perceived Likelihood (proof strength) | /10 | |
| Time Delay (speed to results) | /10 | |
| Effort & Sacrifice (ease) | /10 | |

**Calculated Value Score:**
(DO × PLA) / (TD × E&S) = ___

**Target:** DO and PLA should be 8+, TD and E&S should be 3 or lower.
