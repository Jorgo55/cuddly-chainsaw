## Dimension Weights (Cold Traffic)

**Weights are NOT equal.** For cold traffic, attention + comprehension + credibility dominate.

| Dimension | Weight | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Hook | 20% | Must earn attention first |
| Clarity | 20% | Must be understood instantly |
| Believability | 20% | Must overcome skepticism |
| Relevance | 15% | Must feel personal |
| Emotion | 15% | Must create desire |
| Belief Break | 10% | Only matters after basics land |

### Weighted Average Calculation

```
Weighted Radar = (Hook × 0.20) + (Clarity × 0.20) + (Believability × 0.20) + (Relevance × 0.15) + (Emotion × 0.15) + (Belief Break × 0.10)
```

## Hook (pattern interrupt + immediate self-identification)

**Weight: 20%**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Could be any ad. No tension. No curiosity. |
| 5 | Clear topic, mild curiosity, but still common. |
| 10 | Instant "that's me" + novel frame + curiosity loop. |

**Key question**: Would someone stop scrolling in the first 2 seconds?

---

## Clarity (what is it + why care, in seconds)

**Weight: 20%**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Confusing; multiple messages. |
| 3 | Requires multiple passes to understand (AUTO-KILL threshold) |
| 5 | Understandable after rewatch. |
| 8 | Clear in 1 pass (minimum for PASS verdict) |
| 10 | Crystal clear in 1 pass, even muted. |

**Key question**: Can someone explain what this is after watching once?

**Critical**: Clarity ≤ 3 triggers AUTO-KILL.

---

## Believability (claim-to-proof match)

**Weight: 20%**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Sounds fake / exaggerated. |
| 3 | Claims outpace proof significantly (AUTO-KILL threshold) |
| 5 | Plausible but under-supported. |
| 7 | Proof matches claim (minimum for PASS verdict) |
| 10 | Proof/mechanism overwhelms skepticism. |

**Key question**: Would a skeptic believe this or laugh at it?

**Critical**: Believability ≤ 3 triggers AUTO-KILL.

---

## Relevance (does it feel like it's for me)

**Weight: 15%**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Broad and generic. |
| 5 | Some targeting cues. |
| 10 | Specific cues (situations, pains, context, identity). |

**Key question**: Does the target audience see themselves in this?

---

## Emotion (desire/fear/relief/hope intensity)

**Weight: 15%**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Flat informational. |
| 5 | Mild emotion; not sticky. |
| 10 | Strong visceral pull (relief, envy, urgency, hope). |

**Key question**: Does this create a feeling or just transfer information?

---

## Belief Break (changes a "known truth" in the buyer's mind)

**Weight: 10%**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Says what everyone says. |
| 5 | Light reframe. |
| 10 | Sharp reversal: "You thought X; actually Y—and here's why." |

**Key question**: Does this challenge what the audience already believes?

## Score Bands (Weighted Average)

| Band | Weighted Radar | Verdict Impact |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Strong | ≥ 7.5 | Eligible for PASS |
| Medium | 5.5 - 7.4 | REVISE territory |
| Weak | < 5.5 | KILL territory |
