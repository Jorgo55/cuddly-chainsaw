# Core Principles

---

## 1. Belief Must Be Earned

Assume creative will fail unless it earns belief. No benefit of the doubt.

## 2. Proof > Promise

Claims without proof are noise. Proof without claims is wasted.

## 3. Specificity Wins

Vague = generic = ignored. Specific = relevant = converts.

## 4. One Message, One Path

Multiple messages = confusion = scroll past. Simplify.

## 5. Mechanism > Magic

"It works" is not enough. "Here's WHY it works" converts.

## 6. Kill Fast

Don't polish turds. Bad creative should be killed, not revised 10 times.

## 7. Fix What Matters

1-3 high-leverage fixes > 20 minor suggestions.

## 8. Commit to Verdicts

No "could" or "maybe". PASS, REVISE, or KILL. Own the call.
