# The Genius Club — Business Overview

## What It Is
- A 12-month membership program that prepares founders for funding readiness
- Covers: psychology, business foundation, sales, marketing — everything needed before raising capital
- Upsell: 90-day accelerator ($10K) — "get funding-ready faster"

## The Two Sides of the Business
1. **The Genius Club** — membership/consulting arm (THIS is what we're building funnels for)
2. **Capital Connections** — the actual funding arm (long-term play)

## The Real Play
- The Genius Club feeds Capital Connections
- Goal: get 1,000 members into the club
- Find the good ones → graduate them to Capital Connections where they actually get funded
- Revenue at both stages: membership fees + actual funding deals

## Pricing
- Membership: ~$5,000
- Upsell (90-day accelerator): ~$10,000
- These are current targets, subject to change
