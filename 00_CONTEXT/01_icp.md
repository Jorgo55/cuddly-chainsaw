# ICP — Ideal Customer Profile & Targeting

## The "Frustrated Founder" — Core Signal
Engine is running (profit), but the chassis is shaking. Infrastructure friction.

---

| Dimension | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue/Profit | $250K–$2M annual profit |

| Ops Hiring | Job Boards: Posting for "COO," "Ops Manager," or "Chief of Staff" |
| Podcast Activity | ListenNotes: Speaking about "Scaling Hurdles" or "Growth Pains" |

## 3. PSYCHOGRAPHIC PROFILES

### The "Red-Liner"
- Successful but miserable
- Nervous system at 100% capacity
- Making money but burning out — can't sustain the pace
- Knows something is wrong but can't stop long enough to fix it

### The "Pitch-Deck Prisoner"
- 10+ investor meetings, receiving "soft nos"
- Can't see their own operational mess
- Keeps refining the pitch when the problem is the business foundation
- Ego-invested in the fundraising process itself

### The "Expert Bottleneck"
- Founder is the smartest person in the room
- Neurologically unable to delegate
- Everything runs through them — single point of failure
- Business can't scale because the founder IS the business

## 4. SCRAPING & COMMUNITY TARGETS

### Communities
- Founder Slack Groups: Launch/YC, SaaS Alliance
- Subreddits: r/startups, r/SaaS
- Venture Debt Lists: founders seeking debt (signals they can't close equity rounds)
- Existing asset: 50K scraped from largest paid Slack founder group

### ZoomInfo / Apollo Filters
| Filter | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Filter 1 | Title: Founder / CEO |
| Filter 2 | Company Age: 2–5 years |
| Filter 3 | Bio Keywords: "Scaling," "Series A," "Ex-[Big Tech]" |
| Filter 4 (Trigger) | Hiring in Sales/Ops increased >20% in last 6 months |

---

## 5. WHO WE ELIMINATE
- Pre-revenue startups (dreamers with no money to invest)
- Businesses under $250K/year revenue
- "Curious" tire-kickers with no real business
- People who aren't actively seeking funding RIGHT NOW
- Startups with zero employees (solo dreamers)
- Companies older than 5 years still at seed (likely zombie companies)

---

## 6. WHY THIS ICP CONVERTS
- They already have money to pay ($5K–$10K is doable)
- They're in active pain (failed fundraising attempts)
- Their desire (funding) is the perfect hook for our bait-and-switch
- They're psychologically primed — told "no" enough times
- High urgency: they need capital NOW, not in 2-3 years
- The behavioral signals are SCRAPEABLE — we can find these people programmatically

## 7. THE OUTBOUND HOOK (Cold Email Template)

**Subject:** Your 10th Investor Meeting.

**Body:**
> "Most founders think a 'No' from a VC is a market problem. After 23 years of working with IPO founders, I can tell you it's usually an Infrastructure Problem. VCs don't invest in 'Spaghetti Messes' — they invest in Machines. We've built a 3-minute Audit to show you exactly where your capacity is red-lining."

## 8. LANDING PAGE FILTER RULES
- Headline must call out $250K+ explicitly
- Self-selection: if you don't make that, you bounce
- This protects ad spend — Meta learns from who engages
- Wrong traffic teaches Meta to find more wrong people
- Right traffic teaches Meta to find more right people
- Language should resonate with the 3 psychographic profiles above
