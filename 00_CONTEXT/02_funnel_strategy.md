# Funnel Strategy — The Genius Club

## The Core Mechanism: "Bait & Switch" (Florian's Strategy)

### The Hook (What They Think They're Getting)
"We can get you funding."

### The Switch (What Actually Happens)
Salesperson on the call reveals: "You're NOT ready for funding. If we gave you money now, your business would collapse. Here's why — and here's what you need first."

### Why This Is Genius
- You're not selling against resistance — you're selling INTO their desire
- The "bad news" creates a new perspective they can't ignore
- Even if they reject it initially, they come back 3 months later after failing again
- The follow-up writes itself: "Hey, did you get your funding yet? No? Let's talk."

### Florian's Analogy (The Closer Analogy)
- Everyone wants closers (salespeople) for their business
- "I have closers in my network, I can get you a closer"
- Person comes in → audit reveals: "You don't have enough leads to justify paying a good closer"
- "You're not ready for a closer. First, let's build your fundamentals."
- Same mechanism, different industry. Universal pattern.

## PRIMARY FUNNEL (Build This First)

### Type: Simple Lead-to-Booking Funnel
NOT a VSL funnel. NOT a questionnaire funnel. Simple and direct.

### Why NOT VSL for This Strategy
- The qualification call IS the selling point
- VSL would pre-qualify/educate too much
- You WANT them slightly unqualified so the "you're not ready" reveal hits harder
- The call is where the magic happens, not the video

### Flow

```
Landing Page → Short Video → Lead Capture → Booking → Thank You Page
```

#### 1. Landing Page
- **Headline**: Crystal clear — "Get Funding for Your Business" (or similar)
- **Sub-headline**: Filter — "For businesses making $250K+ per year"
- **Short video**: NOT a full VSL. Just enough to explain the offer
- **Timer/gate on video**: People must watch before they can proceed
- **After video**: Lead capture form (first name, last name, phone, email)
- **CTA**: Book a call / Apply

#### 2. Booking Step
- Calendar integration
- Qualification questions at booking (filters out "just curious" people)
- If answers = clearly unqualified → cancel/don't schedule

#### 3. Thank You Page
- Confirmation of booking
- **BONUS VIDEO**: "Here's what you'll get on the call" — sets expectations, increases show rate
- Free audit teaser as bonus value
- Explain exactly what happens next so they show up

### Key Landing Page Rules (from Martin)
1. Person must instantly know what they're getting → FUNDING
2. Must eliminate wrong people from headline level
3. Clarity = show-up rate. Confused people don't show.
4. Everything the visitor sees should answer: "Am I in the right place? Is this for me?"

## SECONDARY FUNNEL (Build Later)

### Type: Questionnaire / Audit Funnel
- Landing page → Questionnaire → Audit results → Call booking
- "Get a free audit to see if your business is qualified for scaling/funding"
- Higher quality leads, lower volume
- Different purpose: education-first approach

### Florian's Original Concept
- Already has a first landing page drafted (not complete)
- Pitches an audit, then questionnaire, then call
- This is the HIGHER QUALITY but LOWER VOLUME path

---

## SECONDARY FUNNEL #2 (Concept Stage)

### Type: Button Switch Strategy / VSL Funnel
- Landing page → VSL → Booking → Thank you
- Not built yet
- For when we want highest possible lead quality
- Least volume, most qualified

## Funnel Priority Order
1. **Simple funding hook funnel** ← BUILD THIS FIRST
2. Questionnaire/audit funnel ← later
3. VSL/button switch funnel ← later
