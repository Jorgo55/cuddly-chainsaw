# Sales Mechanism & Call Flow

## The Sales Call Structure

### Pre-Call
- Automated email + SMS confirmation at booking
- Reminder 30 min before call
- Google Meet link (NOT Zoom — free, no download needed, scales cheaper)

### On The Call
1. "So you want funding — great, tell me about your business"
2. Strategic qualification questions (revenue, team, systems, marketing, etc.)
3. The Reveal: "I have bad news — you're not ready for funding"
4. Explain WHY: psychology not ready + business foundation not ready
5. "If we gave you money now, it would collapse your business"
6. Present the solution: The Genius Club — we get you READY for funding
7. Offer: $5K membership (12 months) or $10K accelerator (90 days)

### Post-Call (If They Say No)
- They go try to get funding on their own
- They fail (again)
- 3 months later, follow-up: "Hey, did you get your funding? No? Let's talk again."
- NOW they're ready to buy — the seed was planted

## Why This Mechanism Converts

### The Psychological Loop
1. Desire: "I want funding"
2. Hope: "These guys say they can get me funding"
3. Reality check: "You're not ready" (new perspective implanted)
4. Resistance: "Yes I am, I'll do it myself"
5. Failure: They try and fail again
6. Return: "Maybe Andy was right..."
7. Purchase: Now they buy the club membership

### No Hard Sell Needed
- The call to book is a CONSEQUENCE of wanting funding, not a sales pitch
- "If you want funds, we need to know about you → take a call"
- Expected 40-50% of leads will book a call (Florian's estimate)
- This is naturally high because the CTA aligns with their desire

## Follow-Up Sequences
- Email + SMS automations post-booking
- Post-rejection nurture (3-month cycle)
- "Did you get funded yet?" re-engagement

## CRM & Automation Requirements
- Go High Level (GHL) as CRM
- Full automation: registration → CRM → email/SMS → booking → reminders
- Salesperson just picks up calls at booked times
- No middleman/SDR needed initially — automation handles pre-qualification
- Qualification questions at booking filter out obvious tire-kickers
