# Traffic Strategy & Data Assets

## Existing Asset: 50K Founder List
- Scraped from the **largest Slack group for founders**
- These founders are PAYING members (~$10/month for Slack group)
- Scraped via AI bots built by Andy's previous team
- Quality indicator: they pay to be in the group = they're serious
- Quality caveat: need to verify email deliverability / active emails

## Phase 1: Test with the List (Before Ads)
- Don't jump straight to ads
- Use existing 50K list to get first data through the funnel
- Goal: collect initial conversion data, test messaging, validate funnel

### Grey Hat Email Approach
- Custom SMTP setup (not relying on tools like Instantly)
- Focus on the infrastructure layer, not the software layer
- Send rate: 1 email per minute to avoid blocks
- Full 50K list contactable in ~5-10 days
- Can contact each person 3-4 times
- NOT spoofing, NOT black hat — grey area cold outreach

### White Hat Approach
- Upload list to Meta as custom audience
- Create lookalike audiences from the list
- This is the legit, scalable play
- The list is a massive boost for Meta's algorithm if the emails match

## Phase 2: Paid Ads (After Initial Data)
- Meta ads primary channel
- The 50K list seeds the lookalike audiences
- Initial funnel data informs ad targeting
- Key: headline filtering ($250K+) protects ad spend from bad signals
- Meta learns from who engages — wrong traffic = more wrong traffic

## Phase 3: Other Channels (Future)
- Referral partners
- Joint ventures (JVs)
- Dedicated sales teams
- Google (different dynamic than Meta — people search with intent)

## Our Edge
- $200M worth of ad spend data scraped and language-modeled
- We know what works and what doesn't in funnels — from data, not theory
- Custom dev capability: can build anything (funnels, CRM integrations, automations)
- SMTP/email infrastructure knowledge (not dependent on 3rd party tools)

## Data-First Approach
- Test with list → collect data → optimize funnel → THEN scale with ads
- Don't burn ad budget on an unproven funnel
- Let the data tell us what's working before we pour money in
