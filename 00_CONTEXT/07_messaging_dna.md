# Messaging DNA — Core Copy Angles

## The One-Liner
"You want funding? We can get you funding. But first, let's make sure you're ready."

## Primary Desire (What They Want)
- Capital injection / funding for their business
- Money to scale
- Successful investor meetings

## Primary Pain (What They're Experiencing)
- 6+ months searching for funding
- 10+ failed investor meetings
- Feeling stuck — business can't grow without capital
- Frustration with the fundraising process

## The Big Idea
Most founders who want funding aren't actually ready for it. If they got the money today, it would collapse their business — not save it. The missing piece isn't capital. It's foundation.

## Core Message Framework

### Hook Level
- "Get funding for your business"
- "Stop failing investor meetings"
- "Why investors keep saying no (and how to fix it)"

### Filter Level
- "For founders making $250K+/year"
- "If your business generates $250K+ and you need capital to scale"

### Promise Level
- "We connect founders with funding"
- "Get the capital injection your business needs"

### Mechanism Level (Revealed on Call)
- "You're not ready for funding — here's why"
- "If we gave you money today, your business would collapse"
- "The reason investors say no isn't your pitch — it's your foundation"

### Solution Level
- "Get funding-ready in 12 months (or 90 days with the accelerator)"
- "Build the foundation that makes investors say yes"

## Messaging Rules
1. NEVER sell the club on the landing page — sell the FUNDING
2. The club is revealed on the call as the solution to their unreadiness
3. Landing page copy must be dead simple — no marketing jargon
4. Filter aggressively in the headline — $250K+ must be visible
5. Clarity > cleverness. Person must know in 3 seconds: "This is about getting funding"

## Tone
- Confident, not hype-y
- Expert positioning — "we know what investors want"
- Slightly exclusive — "not everyone qualifies"
- Direct — no fluff, no motivational BS

## The Follow-Up Angle (3 Months Later)
"Hey [Name], we spoke 3 months ago about getting your business funded. Did you succeed? If not, let's talk — the offer still stands."
