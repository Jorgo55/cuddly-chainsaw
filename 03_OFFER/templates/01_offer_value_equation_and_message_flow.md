# Offer Value Equation + Message Flow (Canon)

This document defines the core offer framework and the default persuasion flow used by OfferOps.

---

## 1) Value Equation (must optimize all 4 variables)

Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

### A) Dream Outcome (DO)
- The measurable outcome the buyer wants.
- Example target mentioned: **“100 clients per month”**
- Rule: outcomes must be **specific** (who, what, timeframe). Vague outcomes reduce perceived likelihood.

### B) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (PLA)
Increase PLA with:
- Testimonials
- Case studies
- Results (screenshots/metrics with context)

**PLA rule:** proof must be **contexted** (who it worked for + timeframe + constraints).

### C) Time Delay (TD)
Reduce TD with:
- “Quickstart” steps (early wins)
- Clear timeframe to first improvement
- A completion timeline (e.g., “2 weeks to complete”) is fine, but must include faster early milestones.

### D) Effort & Sacrifice (E&S)
Reduce E&S with:
- Step-by-step instruction
- Templates / swipe files / checklists
- “Time saving” emphasis
- Clear “what to do next” sequencing

## 2) Default Message Flow (ad / landing page)

Use this sequence unless instructed otherwise:
1) Hook
2) Jealousy / contrast
3) Dig into the problem
4) Present product as the solution (mechanism)
5) Easy / quick / safe framing (reduce TD and E&S)
6) Objection handling
7) Social proof (testimonials / case studies / results)
8) CTA

---

## 3) Problem framing (core)
- “Meta is constantly changing, so what worked yesterday might not work today.”
- Pain hook example: “Tired of losing money?”

---

## 4) Offer components (from source notes)
Stated offer components:
- Real-time updates on algorithm changes (stay ahead of the curve)
- Step-by-step course to replicate winning creative approaches (reduce effort)
- Time saving + results focus

Stated proof claims (must be validated before used as fact):
- “Trusted by 1000+ clients”
- “Takes 2 weeks to complete”
- “Average client sees a positive return in 7 days”
- Testimonials

---

## 5) Claim safety rules (IMPORTANT)
Any of the following are *not* automatically true just because they appear in notes:
- “Trusted by 1000+ clients”
- “Average positive return in 7 days”
- “Instant success”

**Policy:**
- If proof is provided → mark PROVEN.
- If no proof is provided → mark PLAUSIBLE and soften language.
- If it implies guaranteed outcomes (e.g., “instant success”) → mark RISKY and rewrite.

Rewrite examples:
- “instant success” → “faster wins” / “shorten the learning curve” / “first improvements faster”
- “average positive return in 7 days” → “many clients report early positive signals within ~7 days (varies)”

---

## 6) Proof types checklist
When building social proof, classify proof as:
- Testimonial (objection it addresses)
- Case study (before/after metrics + context)
- Results snippet (metric + timeframe + conditions)

---

## 7) CTA rule
CTA must be one clean action:
- Buy now / enroll
- Book a call
- DM keyword
- Join waitlist
