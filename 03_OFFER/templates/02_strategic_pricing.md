# Strategic Pricing (Canon)

Strategic pricing is crucial in creating an irresistible offer because it directly influences a customer's perception of **value**, **affordability**, and **urgency**.

It can also make an offer more attractive and compelling, ultimately driving higher conversion rates.

## Why strategic pricing matters

### 1) Value Proposition
Pricing affects how customers perceive the value of a product or service.
A well-positioned price can enhance perceived benefits and make the offer seem more valuable.

Example:
- Normally $200, now just $99

### 2) Market Positioning
Strategic pricing helps position your product/service relative to competitors.
Competitive pricing can make your offer more attractive in a crowded market.

Example:
- Our service is 20% cheaper than the leading competitor, with no compromise on quality.

### 3) Urgency and Scarcity (via pricing)
Set a higher original price, then offer a discount so the new price feels like a great deal.
This leverages **price anchoring**.

Example:
- Was $150, now $75 — get it at half the price for a limited time.

### 4) Tailored Pricing
Tailor offers to different customer segments to maximize appeal across diverse groups.

Example:
- Student discount: Get 15% off with your valid student ID

### 5) Bundled Pricing
Offer products/services at a discounted bundle price to encourage customers to buy more than planned.

Example:
- Buy one, get one free — perfect for sharing with friends or family.
