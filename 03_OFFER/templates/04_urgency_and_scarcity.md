# Urgency & Scarcity (Canon)

This document defines urgency and scarcity mechanisms to increase action-taking without changing the core offer.

---

## Definitions

### Urgency
A time-based reason to act now.

### Scarcity
A quantity-based limitation (seats/units/bonuses/access).

---

## Urgency types
- **Group timing:** Next group starts Monday
- **Rolling urgency:** Rolling / ongoing deadlines (time windows)
- **Seasonal urgency:** Summer special (seasonal window)
- **Pricing/bonuses urgency:** price change / bonuses expiring
- **Opportunity urgency:** “You can wait, but the opportunity gets smaller every second”

---

## Scarcity types
- **Limited number of seats/units**
- **Only accepting X clients**
- **Limited supply on bonuses**
- **Never available again** (use sparingly; must be true)

---

## Example lines / swipe
- Next group starts Monday.
- Summer special.

## Reference pattern (luxury scarcity)
Louis Vuitton style scarcity model:
- They only send 1–2 items to each store.
- Stores don’t know what’s coming in the next delivery.

Use this as inspiration for controlled, believable scarcity.
