# Offer / Product Naming Formula (M-A-G-I-C) (Canon)

## M-A-G-I-C Formula
**M** — Make a Magnetic Reason Why  
**A** — Announce Your Avatar  
**G** — Give Them a Goal  
**I** — Indicate a Time Interval  
**C** — Complete with a Container Word

**Note:**
- Not everything needs to be named this way, but it’s very useful for naming programs and promotions.
- You don’t always need all five. Aim to incorporate at least **3** elements.

## Examples (from notes)
- 6 week stress relief challenge
- 60 minute “make your friends jealous” hair model system
- Free 6 week “lean by Halloween” makeover
- 57% off celebrity smile transformation
- Tightness? $1 message new client summer special
- 5 clients in 5 days blueprint
- Fill your gym in 30 days

## Value principle: speed increases value
The faster you can get your target market to the desired outcome, the better (often increases perceived value).

Example:
- A 60-minute back massage is less valuable than a 5-minute massage **if the outcome is the same**.

## Refreshing an offer (reverse order of difficulty / operational drag)
Refresh in this order (easiest → harder):
1) Change the creative (images/pictures in ads)
2) Change the body copy in ads
3) Change the headline (“wrapper” of the offer)
   - Example: Free 6Wk Lean Challenge → Free 6Wk Tone Challenge
   - Example: Holiday Hangover → New Year New You
4) Change the duration of the offer
   - 1 week → 7 days
   - 1 month → 6 weeks
5) Change the enhancer (free/discount component)

---

## Bonuses: quick wins improve success
If the core offer is long, introduce quick-win bonuses to reduce perceived time delay and increase perceived likelihood.

Example:
- Selling CRM software that helps businesses get more leads
- Bonus: “Clear your inbox in 30 minutes”
