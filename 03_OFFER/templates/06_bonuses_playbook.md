# Bonuses Playbook: What Makes a Good Bonus (Canon)

---

## 1) Bonuses should be FREE and more valuable than the core offering
Making bonuses more valuable than the core offering increases perceived value and makes the decision to buy easier.

The bonus should enhance the overall package.

Example:
- Selling an online course on digital marketing → bonus: exclusive toolkit with ready-to-use templates.

---

## 2) Bonuses should solve all perceived problems
Bonuses should address every potential problem or objection the audience might have with you or the market.

---

## 3) Give bonuses a special name with a benefit in the title
Names matter. Give each bonus a name that communicates value.

Example:
- Instead of “Creative Swipe File”
- Use: “Our $200M plug-and-play creatives”

---

## 4) Explain bonus details clearly (required structure)
When presenting a bonus, follow this structure:
1) How it relates to their issue (relevance)
2) What it is (description)
3) What it will do for them (benefit)
4) How it improves their lives (faster / easier / less effort)

---

## 5) Provide proof
Establish credibility with proof of bonus value:
- statistics
- client testimonials
- personal experience
- results

---

## 6) Assign a monetary value and justify it
Assign a monetary value to each bonus to increase perceived value.

Example framing:
- Main course: £997
- Bonus 1 = Was £497 | Get it today for FREE
- Bonus 2 = Was £997 | Get it today for FREE
- Bonus 3 = Was £297 | Get it today for FREE

Total:
- Get £2,791 worth of value for only £997

---

## 7) Prioritize bonuses that provide immediate value
Prefer bonuses with immediate, actionable value (less time/effort).

Example:
- Tools and checklists often outperform additional training because they require less time and effort.

---

## 8) Present bonuses after stating the price
Timing rule:
- Introduce bonuses immediately after the price of the main offering.
This makes bonuses unexpected and increases perceived value.
