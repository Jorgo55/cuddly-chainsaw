# Power Guarantee (Canon)

Guarantees reduce perceived risk. By addressing concerns and lowering risk, a guarantee can increase conversions and support long-term customer relationships.

> Note: Consumer protection laws vary by country/state and by product type (digital vs physical). Treat any legal references here as a messaging concept and verify requirements for your market.

## Core Guarantee Framing

Many sellers worry:
- “What if scammers take advantage?”
- “What if I go broke offering this?”

The idea: most businesses already provide some form of remedy (refund/repair/replacement/support) when a customer is unhappy, and consumer protection laws often require certain rights.

Use guarantees in advertisements to reduce perceived risk and increase action.

## Example legal reference (from notes)
### Consumer Rights Act 2015 (UK)
Consumers may have a right to reject goods that are:
- unsatisfactory quality
- unfit for purpose
- not as described

Notes mention a 30-day window for full refund in relevant cases.

(Verify applicability by product type and jurisdiction.)
