# Offer: What An Irresistible Offer Is Not (Canon)

These items are important, but they do NOT make an offer “irresistible” on their own because customers already expect them as standard.

## Not “Irresistible Offer” Ingredients (expected basics)

### Outstanding Customer Service
Excellent customer service matters, but it’s not what makes the offer irresistible.
Customers already expect good service as a standard.

### Amazing Quality
High quality should be a given. Essential, but not enough to stand out.
Everyone claims their product is high quality.

### Having a Great Team
A talented team is crucial, but not a unique selling point.
Customers assume you have competent people behind the product.

### Great Reputation
Reputation builds trust, but it’s not the primary driver of an irresistible offer.
Your reputation supports the offer, it doesn’t define it.

### Free Shipping
Nice perk, but common expectation.
Won’t make the offer irresistible by itself.

### Biggest Range at the Best Prices
Important, but not unique.
Many businesses can claim the same.

### “We’ve Been in Business Since 1979”
Longevity can imply reliability but isn’t compelling enough to be the main offer driver.
Customers care more about what they get now.

## Core takeaway
No one cares about those basics as the reason to buy.

What makes an offer irresistible is:
- unique elements that provide exceptional value
- urgency
- a clear, compelling reason to act now
