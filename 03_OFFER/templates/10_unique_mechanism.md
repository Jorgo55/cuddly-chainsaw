## Example

**Name**: The Infrastructure Audit

**What It Is**: A diagnostic assessment that maps exactly where a founder's business breaks under scale — psychologically, operationally, and financially.

**Why It Works**: VCs don't invest in "spaghetti messes" — they invest in machines. This audit reveals the 3-5 infrastructure gaps that cause investor rejections before the pitch even matters.

**Why Others Don't Have It**: Built from 23 years of working with IPO founders + $200M in ad spend data that reveals which business foundations actually correlate with funding success.
