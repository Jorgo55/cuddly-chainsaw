# Hook Frameworks (Meta)

## Core Formulas
- **Outcome + Time**: “Get <outcome> in <time> without <pain>.”
- **Before/After**: “From <bad state> to <good state>.”
- **Specific ICP**: “For <ICP>: <outcome> with <mechanism>.”
- **Risk Removal**: “Avoid <risk> when doing <job>.”

## Rules
- One promise, one ICP, one mechanism.
- Prefer concrete nouns and numbers over adjectives.
