# Offer Structures

## Common Structures
- Free audit / scorecard → paid implementation.
- Template + toolkit → paid automation.
- Done-with-you setup → recurring subscription.
- “Pay per outcome” (only if measurable + controllable).

## Guardrails
- Avoid offers that require unlimited custom work.
- Price aligns with pain magnitude and buyer budget.
