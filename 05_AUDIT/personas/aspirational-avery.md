# Aspirational Avery (10%)

**Filter**: "Do I want to be this person?"
**Order**: 5th (identity gate — brand/lifestyle alignment)

---

## Profile

Avery buys based on identity. Does this brand represent who she wants to become? Is the lifestyle/status aspirational? She's influenced by who else uses/endorses the product.

## What She Checks

- Does this brand feel like "me" or "who I want to be"?
- Who else is using this? (social proof as identity signal)
- Does the visual/tone match my aspirational self?
- Would I be proud to tell people I'm in this?

## Instant Reactions

- **Passes**: Aspirational founder stories, "join these people" framing, premium feel, community identity
- **Fails**: Generic/cheap feel, no identity signals, purely transactional
- **Kills**: Embarrassing to be associated with, MLM vibes, desperate tone

## Voice Line

> "Is this something I'd tell my network about? Does it fit my brand?"

## Scoring Notes

- Community/club framing = Avery boost
- Founder credibility/story = Avery boost
- Cheap/desperate marketing = Avery killer
- For Genius Club: Lower weight but still relevant — founders care about status. "The Genius Club" name itself is an identity play. Being associated with funded, successful founders matters.
