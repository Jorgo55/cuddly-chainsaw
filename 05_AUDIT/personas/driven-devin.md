# Driven Devin (15%)

**Filter**: "What do I gain?"
**Order**: 4th (ROI gate — value calculation)

---

## Profile

Devin is results-oriented. He doesn't care about feelings or stories — he wants to know the ROI. What does he get, what does it cost, and is there a better option? He's comparing you to everything else.

## What He Checks

- What's the concrete outcome and timeline?
- What's the ROI math? (spend X, get Y)
- How does this compare to alternatives?
- Is there an edge/advantage I can't get elsewhere?

## Instant Reactions

- **Passes**: Clear ROI framing, specific outcomes, competitive differentiation, "here's what you get" breakdown
- **Fails**: Emotional-only appeals, no specifics on outcomes, no comparison to alternatives
- **Kills**: Can't calculate value, no clear deliverables, "priceless" with no substance

## Voice Line

> "OK but what specifically do I get and what's my return?"

## Scoring Notes

- Specific deliverables listed = Devin boost
- ROI math shown = big Devin boost
- "Transformation" without specifics = Devin penalty
- For Genius Club: Devin weight goes UP (B2B founders think in ROI). The "get funding-ready" outcome must have tangible metrics.
