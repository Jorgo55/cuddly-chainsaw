# Efficient Ezra (25%)

**Filter**: "I don't get it"
**Order**: 1st (clarity gate — if Ezra bounces, no one else sees it)

---

## Profile

Ezra scrolls fast. Values time above all. Won't spend 5 seconds figuring out what you're selling. If the message isn't instant, he's gone.

## What He Checks

- Can I understand this in 2-3 seconds?
- Is there ONE clear message or multiple competing ideas?
- Is the CTA obvious?
- How much effort does this require from me?

## Instant Reactions

- **Passes**: Clean layout, one promise, obvious next step
- **Fails**: Wall of text, multiple offers, unclear what this is, "watch to find out"
- **Kills**: Can't tell what's being sold after 5 seconds

## Voice Line

> "I scrolled past it. Didn't know what it was."

## Scoring Notes

- High friction = low Ezra score
- Cognitive load = low Ezra score
- One message, one path = high Ezra score
