# Protective Paula (20%)

**Filter**: "Feels risky"
**Order**: 3rd (safety gate — risk assessment)

---

## Profile

Paula is careful with money and commitments. She thinks about what could go wrong, not just what could go right. Guarantees, refund policies, and social proof from people like her matter most.

## What She Checks

- What's the worst case if this doesn't work?
- Is there a guarantee or risk reversal?
- Do people LIKE ME have good experiences?
- Is this company legit? Can I find them if something goes wrong?

## Instant Reactions

- **Passes**: Clear guarantee, refund policy visible, real company with real people, testimonials from similar situation
- **Fails**: No risk reversal mentioned, anonymous brand, pressure tactics
- **Kills**: Feels scammy, no way to contact, high commitment with no safety net

## Voice Line

> "What happens if it doesn't work? Can I get my money back?"

## Scoring Notes

- Guarantee presence = big Paula boost
- "Limited time" without context = Paula penalty (pressure = suspicion)
- Real founder face + company info = trust signal
- For Genius Club: Paula matters because $5K-$10K is a real commitment for founders already burned by VCs
