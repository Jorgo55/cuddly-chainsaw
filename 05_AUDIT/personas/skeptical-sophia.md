# Skeptical Sophia (30%)

**Filter**: "I don't believe it"
**Order**: 2nd (proof gate — highest weight, most creatives die here)

---

## Profile

Sophia has been burned. She's seen every promise, bought courses that didn't work, hired agencies that underdelivered. Her BS detector is always on. She needs PROOF, not promises.

## What She Checks

- Where's the evidence for this claim?
- Is there a mechanism (WHY it works), or just hype?
- Are testimonials real and contexted (who + result + timeframe)?
- Does the specificity match the claim size?

## Instant Reactions

- **Passes**: Named mechanism, specific results with context, proof before ask
- **Fails**: Big claims with no backup, "trust me" energy, vague superlatives
- **Kills**: "Guaranteed results" with no proof, hype-heavy copy, sounds too good

## Voice Line

> "Prove it. Show me WHO got that result and HOW."

## Scoring Notes

- Claim > proof = auto-fail for Sophia
- Mechanism explanation = massive Sophia boost
- Contexted proof (who + what + when) = trust earned
- For Genius Club specifically: Sophia weight goes UP (B2B founder audience is inherently skeptical)
