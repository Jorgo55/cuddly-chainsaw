## Email 1 — Confirmation & Outcome Framing

- **Subject Line:** Your [BRAND NAME] call is booked - here’s what to expect…  
- **Preview Text:** Time confirmed + what’s possible when you implement

Hey [First name],

Thanks for booking your strategy session - you're all set for:  
🗓️ [DAY, TIME, TIMEZONE]  
📍 Zoom Link: [INSERT ZOOM LINK]

Please take 10 seconds now to add this to your calendar so you don’t miss it.

On this call, we’ll look at where your business is right now, what’s getting in the way of scaling, and exactly how we’d help you **[insert offer]** - if we’re a fit.

To give you an idea of what’s possible when you plug into our system:

✅ [CLIENT NAME] went from [START POINT] → [END RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME]  
✅ [CLIENT NAME] scaled from [REVENUE] → [REVENUE] in [TIMEFRAME]  
✅ [CLIENT NAME] hit [MILESTONE] after [BRIEF STRATEGY USED]  
✅ [CLIENT NAME] went from [PAIN POINT] → [SUCCESS OUTCOME] in [DURATION]

These aren’t flukes. These are the results of clients who implemented quickly, trusted the process, and stopped guessing.

If we’re a fit, great - we’ll map out the exact strategy to **[insert offer]**.  
If not, we’ll still point you in the right direction.

Talk soon,  
[YOUR NAME]  
Team [BRAND NAME]

## Email 2 — Social Proof / Belief Builder

- **Subject:** How fast can you get results?  
- **Preview:** Fast results come from fast implementation - here’s proof

Hey [FIRST NAME],

You might be wondering...  
"How fast can I actually get results?"

The truth?  
It depends on how quickly you implement - but when you plug into our system and take action, it can happen fast.

Here’s what that’s looked like for a few of our clients:

✅ [CLIENT NAME] went from [START POINT] → [END RESULT] in just [TIMEFRAME]  
✅ [CLIENT NAME] scaled from [REVENUE] → [REVENUE] in [X weeks/months]  
✅ [CLIENT NAME] hit [OUTCOME] using [BRIEF STRATEGY OR SYSTEM]  
✅ [CLIENT NAME] went from [PAIN POINT] to [SUCCESS] in [SHORT TIMEFRAME]

These aren’t one-off wins.  
They're the result of fast implementation and a proven system that removes the guesswork.

📅 Your strategy session is locked in for **[DAY, TIME, TIMEZONE]**.

On the call, we’ll map out exactly how this could work for your business - and what kind of timeline is realistically possible based on where you are right now.

Speak soon,  
[YOUR NAME]  
Team [BRAND NAME]
