# Broadcast Email Strategy

## Who Should Broadcasts Go To?

✅ All engaged subscribers (opened or clicked in last 60–90 days)  
✅ Past customers/clients - to drive repeat engagement, upsells, or referrals
✅ Non-converters - to convert lurkers into first-time buyers or booked calls  

❗️Exclude cold subscribers (no open/click in 90–120+ days) unless you're doing a reactivation campaign.

## Weekly Email Content Rhythm

| Day | Theme | Angle/Goal |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | Social Proof | Build trust. Show who else is using it, how it's working, and why it matters. |
| Tuesday | Value / Problem Solving | Educate. Debunk a myth, teach a trick, or solve a common frustration. |
| Wednesday | Product Demonstration | Show, don't just tell. Use use-cases, video, before/after, routines, etc. |
| Thursday | Soft Sell / Offer | Gently push a CTA (free shipping, bundle, incentive, etc.) |
| Friday | Story / engagement | Share a founder story, brand POV, seasonal hook, or entertaining angle. |

🧠 **Tip:** You can still include a CTA in every email, even in non-offer days - just frame it as “If you’re ready…” or “If this sounds like you…”
