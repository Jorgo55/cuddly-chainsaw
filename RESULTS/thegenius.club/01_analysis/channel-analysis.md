## Channel Comparison for B2B Founder Targeting

| Channel | CPL (B2B avg) | Pros | Cons | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------|------|----------|
| **Meta Ads** | $27-$142 | Massive reach, visual hooks, lookalike audiences from 50K list | Higher CPL for B2B, less intent-based | PRIMARY |
| **Cold Email (50K list)** | ~$0.01-0.05/email | Near-zero cost, owned asset, tests messaging fast | Deliverability risk, grey hat, list quality unknown | FIRST (testing) |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | $100-$200 | Best B2B targeting (title, company size, industry), high intent | Expensive, corporate feel, lower volume | SECONDARY |
| **Google Ads** | $150-$250 | High intent (search-based), bottom-funnel | Very expensive for "startup funding" keywords, competitive | FUTURE |
| **LinkedIn Organic** | Free | Andy/Florian can post thought leadership, builds brand | Slow, unpredictable, requires consistent content | ONGOING |

## Phase 1: Cold Email (50K List) — THE TESTING CHANNEL

### Why Start Here
- **Cost**: Near zero (custom SMTP only)
- **Speed**: Full list contactable in 5-10 days
- **Data**: Get first conversion numbers before spending on ads
- **Risk**: Low — if messaging doesn't work, we find out cheap

### Realistic Benchmarks for Cold Email to Founders
| Metric | Industry Avg | Our Target | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Open Rate | 15-25% | 20%+ | Subject line "Your 10th Investor Meeting" should hit |
| Click Rate | 2-5% | 3%+ | Link to landing page/booking |
| Reply Rate | 1-3% | 2%+ | Some will reply directly |
| Booking Rate (from opens) | 0.5-1.5% | 1%+ | Of people who open |

### Math on 50K List
- 50K emails → ~40K deliverable (80% deliverability assumed)
- 40K × 20% open = 8,000 opens
- 8,000 × 3% click = 240 clicks
- 240 × 25% booking rate from landing = 60 bookings
- **Conservative estimate: 40-80 bookings from the list**
- At 40-50% close rate (Florian's estimate): **16-40 sales**
- At $5K each: **$80K-$200K potential revenue from free list**

### Infrastructure Needs
- Custom SMTP (NOT Instantly or similar tools)
- 1 email/minute send rate
- 3-4 touches per contact over 10-14 days
- Warm-up domain for 2 weeks before blast

## Phase 2: Meta Ads — THE SCALE CHANNEL

### Why Meta (Not LinkedIn) as Primary Paid
1. **50K list → Custom Audience**: Upload list, let Meta find matches
2. **Lookalike audiences**: 1%, 3%, 5% from the list = millions of similar founders
3. **Visual format**: Hook-heavy ads work better than text for this audience
4. **Cost**: Even at B2B CPL ($100-$142), cheaper than LinkedIn for volume
5. **The $250K+ filter**: Headline filtering protects the algorithm from bad signals

### Meta Ad Strategy
| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Objective** | Lead gen / Conversions (to landing page) |
| **Audience 1** | Custom audience (50K list upload) |
| **Audience 2** | Lookalike 1% from list |
| **Audience 3** | Interest-based (startup founders, SaaS, fundraising) |
| **Placement** | Feed + Stories (mobile-first — most Meta traffic) |
| **Creative** | Per-avatar ad sets (Red-Liner, Prisoner, Bottleneck) |
| **Budget** | Start $50-100/day per ad set, scale winners |
| **Testing** | 3-5 hooks per avatar, kill losers in 48 hours |

### Realistic Meta CPL Targets
| Scenario | CPL Target | Monthly Budget | Leads/Month |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Conservative | $100 | $3,000 | 30 |
| Moderate | $70 | $5,000 | 71 |
| Optimistic | $40 | $5,000 | 125 |

### Key: The $250K+ Filter Effect
- The headline filter ($250K+ revenue requirement) will INCREASE CPL
- BUT it will dramatically improve lead quality
- Higher CPL + higher close rate = better unit economics
- Meta learns from conversions — right leads teach the algorithm to find more right leads

## Phase 3: LinkedIn — THE PRECISION CHANNEL

### When to Add LinkedIn
- After Meta proves the funnel converts
- When we want to target specific companies/titles
- For retargeting website visitors on a professional platform

### LinkedIn Approach
| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Ad type** | Sponsored Content (single image + text) |
| **Targeting** | CEO/Founder title, 11-50 employees, SaaS/Fintech/AI industries, 2-5 yr company age |
| **Creative** | Thought leadership + direct CTA |
| **Budget** | $2K-5K/month testing |

For context, SaaS/B2B cold email in 2025:
- Average open rate: 15-25%
- Average reply rate: 1-5%
- "Your 10th Investor Meeting" subject line is HIGHLY specific — should outperform generic
- Personalization in first line increases reply rate by 30-50%
- 3-4 email sequence converts 2-3x better than single touch
