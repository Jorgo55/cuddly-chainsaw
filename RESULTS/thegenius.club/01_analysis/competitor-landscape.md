## Market-Wide Patterns

### What Everyone Does
- Pitch deck refinement
- Investor introductions
- Fundraising strategy
- Data room prep

### What NOBODY Does
- Diagnose the operational/infrastructure problem behind fundraising failure
- Address founder psychology and burnout
- Offer a "you're not ready" honest assessment
- Provide a full business foundation rebuild
- Create a 3-month boomerang system for rejected leads
- Filter aggressively (most take anyone who pays)

### The Opportunity
Every competitor assumes the founder's business is ready and just needs a better pitch or better investor access. NONE of them address the root cause: the business infrastructure is broken, and investors can see it. The Genius Club is the only player saying "you're not ready — let's fix that first."
