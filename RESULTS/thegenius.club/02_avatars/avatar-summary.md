## Emotional Triggers

| Avatar | What Makes Them Stop Scrolling | What Makes Them Book a Call |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Red-Liner** | "You're profitable but not fundable — here's the gap" | Promise of diagnosis that identifies what investors actually reject |
| **Prisoner** | "Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no" | The reframe: it's the business behind the deck, not the deck itself |
| **Bottleneck** | "What happens to your company if you can't work for 90 days?" | Someone who addresses the psychology, not just the tactics of delegation |
| **Reluctant Raiser** | "Your competitor raised $5M with a worse product. You're still trying to win on merit." | Permission to raise without "selling out" + proof they can keep control |
| **Technical Founder** | "Investors don't fund products. They fund businesses. Yours is a product." | Reframe: business infrastructure is just another system to build |
| **Second-Timer** | "You exited once. Investors still said no to #2. Here's why." | Someone who evaluates the NEW business, not the old resume |
| **Agency Escapee** | "$1M in revenue. 10 rejections. All because of one word: 'agency.'" | Proof that hybrid models CAN get funded with the right infrastructure |

## Top Objection Per Avatar

| Avatar | Objection | Root Fear | Our Counter |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Red-Liner** | "I don't have time for a program" | Adding anything = collapse | 90-day sprint integrates INTO operations, doesn't add to the pile |
| **Prisoner** | "Is this just another pitch deck consultant?" | Burned 3 times already | We don't touch the deck. We fix what's behind it. |
| **Bottleneck** | "Nobody can do this as well as I can" | Identity = being indispensable | We build systems to YOUR standard, not generic SOPs |
| **Reluctant Raiser** | "I don't even know if I want to raise" | Commitment terror — paying makes it real | Infrastructure work has value whether you raise or not |
| **Technical Founder** | "This sounds like it's for business people, not engineers" | Fear of being the weakest in a business room | We frame business infrastructure as a system to architect — same rigor as code |
| **Second-Timer** | "I've already built and exited — I don't need a readiness program" | Admitting they need help = admitting experience wasn't enough | BIA strips pedigree and evaluates THIS business on investor criteria |
| **Agency Escapee** | "Is my model even fundable?" | Fear the hybrid model is inherently uninvestable | We've seen hybrid models get funded — you need the right framing and infrastructure |

## Ad Angle Matrix

| Angle Type | Red-Liner | Prisoner | Bottleneck | Reluctant Raiser | Technical Founder | Second-Timer | Agency Escapee |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pain Mirror** | "Your company is profitable. You're not." | "10+ meetings. 10+ soft nos." | "Your COO quit because your business has no systems — just you." | "Watching a funded competitor with a worse product eat your lunch." | "Every investor loves your product. Every investor passes." | "You exited for seven figures. Investors still said no to #2." | "$1M in revenue. Investors call it 'a services business.'" |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | "Pitch deck consultants fix slides. We fix why investors say no." | "Your pitch deck isn't the problem." | "You've been told to delegate. You've tried. It didn't work." | "You're not anti-funding. You're anti-losing-control." | "You don't need a co-founder. You need business infrastructure." | "Your track record opened the meeting. Your operations closed the door." | "Your agency revenue isn't the problem. How you present it is." |
| **Status Filter** | "For founders making $250K+ who can't stop working" | "For founders making $250K+ who can't close a round" | "For founders making $250K+ whose business can't survive without them" | "For bootstrapped founders hitting a growth ceiling they can't break through alone" | "For technical founders whose product is Series A ready but whose business isn't" | "For exited founders who can't figure out why company #2 won't get funded" | "For agency founders with real revenue investors won't respect" |
| **Reframe** | "You don't need more meetings. You need to become unfundable-proof." | "Stop fixing the pitch. Start fixing the business." | "Investors don't fund founders. They fund machines." | "Raising doesn't mean you failed at bootstrapping. It means you succeeded." | "Business infrastructure is just another system to build." | "Investors evaluate the business in front of them, not the one you exited." | "Your agency experience is your unfair advantage — not your albatross." |
| **Aspiration** | "What if your company ran without requiring your organs?" | "What if investors couldn't say no?" | "What if you took 90 days off and came back to a bigger company?" | "What if you could raise on YOUR terms and keep control?" | "What if your business was as investable as your product is excellent?" | "What if company #2 was bigger than company #1?" | "What if investors saw a platform instead of an agency?" |

## Conversion Path Per Avatar

| Stage | Red-Liner | Prisoner | Bottleneck | Reluctant Raiser | Technical Founder | Second-Timer | Agency Escapee |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Hook** | Your body is telling you what investors already know | Your deck is fine. Your business isn't. | You ARE the risk investors won't take | Your competitor raised $5M with a worse product | Your product is 10/10. Your business is 2/10. | Your exit won't raise your next round | $1M revenue and investors say "it doesn't count" |
| **Problem** | Burning out = unfundable | Polishing the wrong thing | Single point of failure = dealbreaker | Growth ceiling + funded competitors | Built one layer, investors evaluate four | Coasting on reputation, skipping fundamentals | Dismissed as "services" despite real traction |
| **Mechanism** | Audit reveals ops gaps killing you AND your fundraise | Audit shows what investors actually evaluate | Audit shows founder-dependency score | Audit shows what raising looks like from strength | Audit translates product company into investable business | Audit evaluates THIS business, not last exit | Audit reframes hybrid model as fundable |
| **Solution** | Build the machine → get funded | Fix the foundation → close the round | Build systems → become investable | Build infrastructure → raise on your terms | Build business layer → match product quality | Build from scratch → prove it's not luck | Build clean narrative → get the meeting you deserve |
| **CTA** | Book a call to see where you're red-lining | Book a call to see what investors really see | Book a call to get your dependency score | Book a call to see if raising makes sense | Book a call to see what's behind your product | Book a call to see what investors see in company #2 | Book a call to see how to make your model fundable |
