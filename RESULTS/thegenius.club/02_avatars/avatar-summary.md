## Emotional Triggers

| Avatar | What Makes Them Stop Scrolling | What Makes Them Book a Call |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Red-Liner** | "You're profitable but not fundable — here's the gap" | Promise of diagnosis that identifies what investors actually reject |
| **Prisoner** | "Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no" | The reframe: it's the business behind the deck, not the deck itself |
| **Bottleneck** | "What happens to your company if you can't work for 90 days?" | Someone who addresses the psychology, not just the tactics of delegation |

## Top Objection Per Avatar

| Avatar | Objection | Root Fear | Our Counter |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Red-Liner** | "I don't have time for a program" | Adding anything = collapse | 90-day sprint integrates INTO operations, doesn't add to the pile |
| **Prisoner** | "Is this just another pitch deck consultant?" | Burned 3 times already | We don't touch the deck. We fix what's behind it. |
| **Bottleneck** | "Nobody can do this as well as I can" | Identity = being indispensable | We build systems to YOUR standard, not generic SOPs |

## Ad Angle Matrix

| Angle Type | Red-Liner Hook | Prisoner Hook | Bottleneck Hook |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Pain Mirror** | "Your company is profitable. You're not." | "10+ meetings. 10+ soft nos." | "Your COO quit because your business has no systems — just you." |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | "Pitch deck consultants fix slides. We fix why investors say no." | "Your pitch deck isn't the problem." | "You've been told to delegate. You've tried. It didn't work." |
| **Status Filter** | "For founders making $250K+ who can't stop working" | "For founders making $250K+ who can't close a round" | "For founders making $250K+ whose business can't survive without them" |
| **Reframe** | "You don't need more meetings. You need to become unfundable-proof." | "Stop fixing the pitch. Start fixing the business." | "Investors don't fund founders. They fund machines." |
| **Aspiration** | "What if your company ran without requiring your organs?" | "What if investors couldn't say no?" | "What if you took 90 days off and came back to a bigger company?" |

## Conversion Path Per Avatar

| Stage | Red-Liner | Prisoner | Bottleneck |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Hook** | Your body is telling you what investors already know | Your deck is fine. Your business isn't. | You ARE the risk investors won't take |
| **Problem** | Burning out = unfundable | Polishing the wrong thing | Single point of failure = dealbreaker |
| **Mechanism** | Infrastructure Audit reveals ops gaps | Audit shows what investors actually evaluate | Audit shows founder-dependency score |
| **Solution** | Build the machine → get funded | Fix the foundation → close the round | Build systems → become investable |
| **CTA** | Book a call to see where you're red-lining | Book a call to see what investors really see | Book a call to get your dependency score |
