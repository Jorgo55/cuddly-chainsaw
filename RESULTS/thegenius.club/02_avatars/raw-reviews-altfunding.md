## SUMMARY: KEY LANGUAGE PATTERNS FOR AVATAR MINING

### Why founders chose alternative funding (anti-VC language):
- "running your company for someone else's goals"
- "toxic substance that destroys startups"
- "fundraising is a full-time job"
- "round after round, like going back to the drug dealer"
- "hold out for something bigger" (VC blocking exits)
- "70-80% of VCs add negative value"
- "pennies on the dollar" after VC blocked $88M exit
- "maximum happiness for the maximum amount of time"
- "smaller exit but bigger payout"
- "kept 100% equity"

### What they expected from alt-funding:
- Speed (24-48 hours)
- No equity dilution
- No board seats
- Simple process
- Partnership feeling ("more like a partner than a bank")
- Human connection ("real people who understand your business")

### What disappointed them:
- Bait-and-switch on amounts ($3M to $350K)
- Hidden effective APR (advertised flat fee masks 35-42% real cost)
- Funds held or withdrawn without consent
- Ghosting after application
- Support vanishing after signing
- Moving goalposts on eligibility
- Non-negotiable take-it-or-leave-it offers

### Strongest emotional triggers:
- **Betrayal after loyalty** (repeat customer gets rejected)
- **Broken promises** (approved then reversed at last minute)
- **Financial violation** (unauthorized withdrawals, held funds)
- **Time theft** (weeks of process for nothing)
- **Being misunderstood** ("underwriter doesn't understand ecommerce")
- **Abandonment** (great sales team, zero support after)
- **Control** (keeping equity, board seats, decision-making)
- **Speed/time** (founders are time-poor above all else)
- **Relief** (finally someone said yes)
