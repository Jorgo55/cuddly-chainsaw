## LANGUAGE PATTERNS (summary of recurring founder/investor language)

### Pain language (most frequent words and phrases):
- "scam" / "legal scam" / "closest to a legal scam"
- "waste of time and money"
- "zero responses" / "zero ROI" / "zero return"
- "lost every cent" / "lost all my money"
- "no communication" / "ghosted" / "never heard back"
- "hold your money hostage" / "trapped" / "can't sell"
- "broken promises" / "promised everything, delivered nothing"

- "they take their cut and disappear"
- "no oversight, no regulations, no audit"
- "surprise fees" / "hidden costs" / "shifting expectations"
- "doing all the work ourselves"
- "burn your dollars"

### Emotional themes:
1. **Abandonment** -- platform disappears after collecting fees/investment
2. **Powerlessness** -- no rights, no recourse, no voice
3. **Betrayal** -- promises vs. reality gap
4. **Trapped** -- money locked up, can't exit, can't sell
5. **Exhaustion** -- bureaucracy, documentation, endless process
6. **Stigma** -- crowdfunding = signal of weakness to VCs
7. **Isolation** -- "you're on your own" after paying
8. **Public failure risk** -- financials exposed, compressed timeline
9. **Fee exploitation** -- fees on top of fees with no value delivered
10. **Time distortion** -- "always takes longer than you think"

### What founders EXPECTED vs. what they GOT:
| Expected | Got |
|----------|-----|
| Access to investors | Cold contact list / crickets |
| Platform drives 30-35% of raise | Platform drives <5%, founder does 95% |
| Professional support | Automated messages, ghosting |
| Smart money | Amateur investors asking basic questions |
| Quick process | 3-9 months, endless documentation |
| Credibility signal | VC stigma, closed doors for future raises |
| Community of champions | Hundreds of $20 investors to manage |

- Realistic expectations about platform's role
- Treating it as brand-building, not just fundraising
