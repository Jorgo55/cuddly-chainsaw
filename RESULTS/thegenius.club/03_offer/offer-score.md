# Offer Score — 54-Point Rubric

---

## Section A: Value Equation (Core)

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|:-----:|---------------|
| **Dream Outcome** | 3 | Specific: "Get funding-ready so investors stop saying no." Measurable via BIA score. Timeframe: 90 days (accelerator) / 12 months (membership). Avatar-specific variants defined. |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | 2 | Authority proof (Andy 23 years, IPO founders). Mechanism proof (BIA framework). BUT: no case studies, no testimonials, no before/after data. First cohort = inherent proof gap. |
| **Time Delay** | 3 | Quick win: BIA results in Week 2. Clear milestones: 90-day sprint calendar. Monthly checkpoints. Fast enough to feel urgent, structured enough to feel achievable. |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | 2 | Done-with-you format + templates + frameworks reduce effort significantly. But still 5-8 hrs/week for accelerator — meaningful commitment for burned-out founders. "Integrates INTO operations" framing helps but doesn't eliminate the time cost. |

**Value Equation Score: 10/12**

## Section B: Offer Components

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|:-----:|---------------|
| **Transformation Statement** | 3 | Specific avatar ($250K+ founders), specific outcome (funding-ready), specific mechanism (BIA), specific time (90 days). Multiple variants for different contexts. |
| **Unique Mechanism** | 3 | Proprietary name (BIA). Clear explanation of why it works. Named sub-components (Dependency Score, Repeatability Index, Red Flag Map). Differentiated from every competitor approach. |
| **Offer Name** | 2 | "The Genius Club" = 4/5 MAGIC. Brand-aligned and memorable. "90-Day Funding Machine" strong for accelerator. Loses a point: "Genius Club" doesn't immediately communicate the funding angle to cold traffic. |
| **Pricing Strategy** | 3 | Anchored against $150K COO, $96K-$180K advisor, $100K+ accelerator equity. Stacked with $17K value vs $5K price. Founding member pricing + monthly option. ROI frame included. |
| **Bonuses** | 3 | 4 bonuses, each named, valued, and mapped to specific objections. Capital Connections Priority Access is genuinely exclusive. Total bonus value ($12K) exceeds core offer ($5K). Presented after price. |
| **Guarantee** | 2 | Implementation guarantee is strong and differentiated (not generic money-back). But it requires the member to complete milestones first — some skeptics will see this as a loophole. Could be stronger with a partial money-back component. |
| **Urgency/Scarcity** | 3 | All mechanisms are structurally real: cohort cap (15 seats, Andy reviews each BIA), founding member pricing (first 50), Capital Connections queue. No fake timers. Runway-burning urgency is inherent to the ICP. |
| **Credibility** | 1 | This is the weak link. No case studies, no testimonials, no third-party reviews. Andy's credentials are strong but unverified in our materials. First cohort problem. Mitigation plan exists but isn't executed yet. |

**Offer Components Score: 20/24**

## Section C: Message Flow

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|:-----:|---------------|
| **Hook** | 3 | "Get funding for your business" (desire) + "$250K+" (filter) = pattern-breaking self-identification. Multiple hook variants per avatar tested in Step 2. Counter-intuitive angle ("your pitch deck isn't the problem") is novel in the market. |
| **Problem Agitation** | 3 | Deep pain articulated across 3 avatars: failed meetings, burnout, founder dependency. False solutions explicitly called out (pitch deck consultants, accelerators, networking). Language mined from real founder communities. |
| **Solution Presentation** | 3 | BIA as mechanism is clearly explained — not just "what" but "why it works" and "why competitors don't have it." Named components make it tangible. Investor-lens framing differentiates. |
| **Objection Handling** | 3 | All 5 major objections mapped per avatar with root fears identified and specific counters. "Is this just another pitch deck consultant?" → "We don't touch the deck. We fix what's behind it." Proactive handling in bonuses and guarantee. |
| **Social Proof** | 1 | Weakest dimension. Andy's authority claim is the only real proof. No contexted testimonials, no case studies, no before/after. First cohort problem. Founding member framing is the bridge but it's not proof. |
| **CTA** | 3 | One clear action: "Book Your Free Infrastructure Audit Call." Benefit embedded in the CTA. Free = risk removed. Aligned with desire (audit → funding path). No competing CTAs. |

**Message Flow Score: 16/18**

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)

| Gap | Current Score | Target | Fix |
|-----|:------------:|:------:|-----|
| **Credibility / Social Proof** | 1+1 = 2/6 across both sections | 4/6 | **Priority 1**: Document first 10 members as case studies from Day 1. Record video testimonials at Week 4 and Month 3. Build before/after BIA scores as visual proof. Andy must publish 3-5 LinkedIn posts establishing authority BEFORE launch. |

### Minor Gaps (Fix Before Scale)

| Gap | Current Score | Fix |
|-----|:------------:|-----|
| **Effort & Sacrifice (Value Eq)** | 2/3 | Add "done-for-you" elements to accelerator tier — e.g., "we BUILD your first 3 SOPs with you" vs. just templates |
| **Guarantee** | 2/3 | Consider adding: "If you complete all milestones and your BIA score doesn't improve by at least 40%, full refund." Adds measurable threshold to the guarantee |
| **Offer Name** | 2/3 | "The Genius Club" doesn't scream "funding" to cold traffic. On landing page, lead with "Get Funded" messaging, use "The Genius Club" as the brand once they're inside. Not a rebrand — a positioning adjustment for cold traffic |

## Quick Checks

### Value Equation Quick Test
- [x] Can you state the dream outcome in one specific sentence? → "Get funding-ready in 90 days so investors stop saying no"
- [ ] Do you have 3+ pieces of contexted proof? → NO. Authority claim + mechanism + founding member frame = 2 real pieces. Need case studies.
- [x] Can someone see first results within days? → YES. BIA results in Week 2.
- [x] Is effort minimized with templates/guides/support? → YES. Templates, blueprints, calendar, done-with-you format.

### Offer Stack Quick Test
- [x] Would YOU buy this offer at this price? → YES. $5K vs $150K COO or $100K+ accelerator equity is a no-brainer if you trust the mechanism.
- [x] Is the bonus stack worth more than the core offer? → YES. $12K in bonuses vs $5K core.
- [ ] Does the guarantee remove all risk? → PARTIAL. Implementation guarantee is strong but has conditions. Not zero-risk.
- [x] Is there a real reason to act NOW? → YES. Cohort cap + founding pricing + runway burning.

### Message Quick Test
- [x] Would someone stop scrolling at the hook? → YES. "Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no" is a pattern interrupt.
- [x] Is the mechanism explained? → YES. BIA with named sub-components.
- [x] Are the main 2-3 objections addressed? → YES. All 5 mapped per avatar.
- [x] Is there ONE clear CTA? → YES. "Book Your Free Infrastructure Audit Call."
