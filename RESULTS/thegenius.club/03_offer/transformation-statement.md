## Claim Safety

| Claim | Status | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| "Get funding-ready in 90 days" | PLAUSIBLE | No case studies yet — first cohort. Soften to "funding-ready path" if needed |
| "Investors stop saying no" | RISKY | Implies guaranteed outcome. Use "so investors stop saying 'not yet'" — softer |
| "Find out why investors say no" | PROVEN | The audit delivers this by design |
