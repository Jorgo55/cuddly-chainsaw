## Ad 1: Primary (Feed — Long Form)

**Hook**: Investors don't fund founders. They fund machines.

**Primary Text**:
You built a profitable business. $250K+. Real customers. Real revenue.

But here's the problem investors see and you don't:

Your business IS you. Every decision runs through you. Every escalation ends at your desk. Every system lives in your head.

That's not a company. That's a job with employees.

And investors won't write a check for it. Because if you get hit by a bus, the whole thing dies.

The Business Infrastructure Audit evaluates your business on the same dimensions investors use — starting with the Founder Dependency Score. How much of your company survives without you?

Free call. 30 minutes. The honest answer to a question nobody else will ask you.

## Ad 2: False Solution Callout

**Hook**: You've been told to delegate. You've tried. It didn't work. Here's why.

**Primary Text**:
You hired a COO. They lasted 6 months.
You documented processes. They're 30% done and already outdated.
You tried EOS. The team stopped using it after one quarter.
You read the delegation books. Every time you hand something off, it comes back at 60% of your standard.

None of it worked. Not because delegation is a myth — but because nobody addressed the reason you can't let go.

It's not a hiring problem. It's not a process problem. It's a psychology + systems problem.

The Business Infrastructure Audit identifies both — the operational gaps AND the founder wiring that keeps you in every room.

Free call. 30 minutes. For founders making $250K+ who are done being the bottleneck.

**Headline**: It's Not a Delegation Problem. It's an Infrastructure Problem.
**Description**: Free audit for founders stuck as the single point of failure.

## Ad 3: The COO Story

**Hook**: Your COO quit because your business has no systems — it has you.

**Primary Text**:
You spent 4 months finding them. Offered $160K+ equity. They were sharp.

6 months in, they sat you down: "Every decision I make gets reversed. Every process I build gets overridden. I can't do this job."

They left. You picked up every responsibility they'd been handling. And told yourself: "I should've just done it myself."

But here's the truth: it wasn't a bad hire. It was a broken system. You never built the infrastructure that allows someone else to succeed.

The Infrastructure Audit shows you exactly where the system gaps are — and how to build a business that runs at your standard without you inside it every day.

**Headline**: Stop Hiring. Start Building Systems.
**Description**: Free 30-minute audit for $250K+ founders.

## Ad 4: The 90-Day Test

**Hook**: What happens to your company if you can't work for 90 days?

**Primary Text**:
If the answer terrifies you — that's exactly what investors see.

Every VC asks some version of this question. "What happens if the founder gets hit by a bus?"

And when the answer is "everything stops" — they stop too. That's your "soft no" explained in one sentence.

The Infrastructure Audit measures your Founder Dependency Score — how much of your business survives without you — and maps the exact fixes to change the answer.

Free call. 30 minutes. For founders making $250K+ who are tired of being told they're the risk investors won't take.

**Headline**: You ARE the Risk Investors Won't Take
**Description**: Free Founder Dependency Audit. See your score.

## Ad 5: Aspiration

**Hook**: What if you took 90 days off and came back to a bigger company?

**Primary Text**:
Right now, if you took a week off, things would fall apart.

But the founders who get funded? Their companies run without them. They take vacations. They focus on strategy. They close rounds.

The difference isn't talent. It's infrastructure.

The Business Infrastructure Audit shows you exactly what to build — systems, processes, decision frameworks — so your business operates at your standard without you at the center of every decision.

90 days to go from "can't leave for a week" to "investors can't say no."

Free call. 30 minutes. $250K+ founders only.

**Headline**: Build the Machine. Then Get Funded.
