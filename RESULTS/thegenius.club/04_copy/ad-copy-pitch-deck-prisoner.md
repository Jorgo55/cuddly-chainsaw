## Ad 1: Primary (Feed — Long Form)

**Hook**: Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no.

**Primary Text**:
You've redesigned it 4 times. Hired 2-3 consultants. Rehearsed until you could pitch in your sleep.

And you're STILL getting ghosted after "great meetings."

Here's what nobody told you:

Investors evaluate the business behind the deck. They're checking founder dependency, operational systems, team depth, and scalability. If those don't pass, no slide fixes that.

The Business Infrastructure Audit shows you what investors actually see when they look past your pitch — the structural gaps causing every "soft no."

Free call. 30 minutes. For founders making $250K+.

No deck review. The real diagnosis.

## Ad 2: Resentment Mirror

**Hook**: That startup with half your traction just raised $3M. Here's why.

**Primary Text**:
It's not about the product. It's not about the pitch. It's not about who you know.

It's about the business.

The startups that get funded have clean operations, real teams, and systems that run without the founder in every room.

Yours doesn't. And that's the gap no pitch consultant will ever fix.

The Business Infrastructure Audit shows you exactly what funded startups have that you don't — and how to fix it in 90 days.

**Headline**: Fix What Investors Actually Care About
**Description**: $250K+ founders: stop fixing the deck. Fix the business.

## Ad 3: Sunk Cost

**Hook**: You've spent $10K+ on pitch consultants. Want to know why none of them worked?

**Primary Text**:
Pitch consultants fix slides.

Investors don't reject slides.

They reject businesses that can't scale, founders who can't delegate, and operations held together by duct tape.

You fixed the wrong thing. Three times.

The Infrastructure Audit shows you what actually needs fixing — the stuff behind the deck that investors evaluate and nobody else touches.

Free. 30 minutes. $250K+ founders only.

**Headline**: Stop Fixing the Pitch. Start Fixing the Business.
**Description**: Free Infrastructure Audit for founders who've been burned by pitch consultants.

## Ad 4: Specific Failure Callout

**Hook**: 10+ investor meetings. 10+ "soft nos." Still think the deck is the problem?

**Primary Text**:
Every meeting goes "great." Every investor says "really interesting."

Then the email: "We're going to pass for now."

No specific feedback. No actionable reason. Just silence.

You've been told to refine the narrative. Tighten the TAM slide. Add a customer case study. You've done all of it.

Nothing changed.

Because the answer isn't on any slide. It's in the business behind every slide.

## Ad 5: Counter-Intuitive Truth

**Hook**: The best thing you can do for your fundraise? Stop fundraising.

**Primary Text**:
Sounds backwards. Here's why it works:

Every month you spend pitching an unfundable business is a month wasted. The "soft nos" won't turn into "yeses" because you tweaked a slide.

The smartest move is to pause the raise for 90 days. Fix the infrastructure investors are actually rejecting. Then go back with a completely different story.

The Infrastructure Audit shows you what to fix and in what order.

Free call. 30 minutes. For founders making $250K+ who are done hearing "not yet."

**Headline**: Fix the Business. Then Close the Round.
**Description**: Free audit for $250K+ founders stuck in the fundraising loop.

## Creative Direction Notes

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Format** | Single image + text (feed) preferred. Story ads for Hook 2 and Hook 4 |
| **Image style** | Pitch deck screenshot with red "REJECTED" stamp. OR: side-by-side — "What you're fixing" (deck slide) vs. "What investors actually see" (org chart with founder in every box) |
| **Text-on-black** | "10+ investor meetings. 0 checks. Still think it's the pitch?" — strong for Stories format |
| **Video option** | 15-sec: show a beautiful pitch deck → reveal the messy org chart behind it → "Your pitch deck isn't the problem" |
| **Color palette** | Black/navy + white + red accents (for the rejection/pain angle) |
| **Tone** | Direct but not condescending. This avatar has ego — copy must be respectful while being honest |
