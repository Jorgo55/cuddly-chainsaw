## Ad 1: Primary (Feed — Long Form)

**Hook**: Your company is profitable. You're not.

**Primary Text**:
You built a business doing $250K+ a year. Real revenue. Real customers. Real traction.

And somehow you're working 70-hour weeks, haven't taken a real vacation in 2 years, and every investor you meet says "really interesting" before ghosting you.

Here's the part nobody tells you:

Investors aren't rejecting your pitch. They're rejecting your infrastructure. They see a business that can't survive without you — and that's not investable.

We built something called the Business Infrastructure Audit. It evaluates your business on the exact dimensions investors use: founder dependency, operational systems, team depth, scalability.

On a free 30-minute call, we show you exactly what investors see when they look at your company — and what to fix first.

No pitch deck review. No generic advice. The real diagnosis.

## Ad 2: Contrast / Jealousy

**Hook**: Pitch deck consultants fix slides. We fix why investors actually say no.

**Primary Text**:
You've spent $5K-$15K on pitch consultants. The deck looks great. Investors still pass.

Because the deck was never the problem.

Investors evaluate 14 things before they look at a single slide. Most founders fail on 9 of them. That's why your third consultant didn't work either.

The Business Infrastructure Audit shows you the real gaps — the ones behind the deck.

Free call. 30 minutes. For founders making $250K+.

**Headline**: Stop Fixing the Pitch. Start Fixing the Business.
**Description**: Free audit for founders who've heard "not yet" too many times.

## Ad 3: Aspiration

**Hook**: What if your company ran without requiring your organs?

**Primary Text**:
You're making $250K+. You have a team. You have traction.

But you ARE the business. If you stop, it stops. And investors can see that from the first meeting.

The founders who get funded aren't smarter than you. They built machines. You built a dependency.

The Business Infrastructure Audit shows you exactly where the dependency lives — and how to fix it in 90 days.

Free call. 30 minutes. No pitch deck review.

## Ad 4: Story (Short)

**Hook**: He had 10 investor meetings. 10 "soft nos." Then he stopped fixing the deck.

**Primary Text**:
He was doing $800K/yr. Real product. Real customers. But every investor said the same thing: "Come back when you've built out the team."

He'd already redesigned the pitch deck 3 times. Hired 2 consultants. Made the numbers look "investor-grade."

Nothing changed.

Then someone showed him what investors actually see: a business that dies if he gets sick for a month.

That's not a pitch problem. That's an infrastructure problem.

## Ad 5: Direct / Urgency

**Hook**: For founders making $250K+ who can't stop working.

**Primary Text**:
If your business makes $250K+ and you still can't take a week off — investors already know why they're passing on you.

Every month you spend polishing the pitch instead of fixing the infrastructure is a month of burned runway.

30-minute call. Free Infrastructure Audit. The honest truth about why investors keep saying no.
