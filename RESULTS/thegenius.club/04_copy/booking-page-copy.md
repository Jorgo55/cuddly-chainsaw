## Qualification Questions

These filter tire-kickers without feeling hostile. Framed as "so we can prepare for YOUR call."

### Question 1
**What's your company's annual revenue/profit?**
- Under $100K
- $100K - $250K
- $250K - $500K
- $500K - $1M
- $1M - $2M
- $2M+

*Disqualify*: Under $250K → redirect to "We're not the right fit yet" page (soft rejection, not hostile)

### Question 2
**How many full-time employees do you have?**
- Just me (solo)
- 2-5
- 5-15
- 15-25
- 25+

*Flag*: Solo → likely not ready for program. Still allow booking but flag for salesperson.

### Question 3
**How many investor meetings have you had in the last 12 months?**
- 0 (haven't started)
- 1-5
- 5-10
- 10+

*Context*: Helps salesperson calibrate the call. 10+ = strong ICP signal.

### Question 4
**What's your biggest challenge with fundraising right now?**
- Can't get meetings
- Getting meetings but getting rejected
- Don't know what investors actually want
- Running the business and fundraising at the same time is killing me
- Other (free text)

*Context*: Maps to avatar type. "Getting meetings but rejected" = Prisoner. "Running both is killing me" = Red-Liner. Salesperson uses this to calibrate the "you're not ready" reveal.

### Question 5
**How soon are you looking to raise capital?**
- ASAP — actively fundraising now
- Next 3 months
- Next 6-12 months
- Exploring options

*Priority*: "ASAP" and "Next 3 months" = highest urgency, prioritize in scheduling.

- We'll run a mini Infrastructure Audit on your business
- You'll get specific, actionable insights — not a sales pitch
- Come prepared to talk openly about your business operations, team, and funding history

## Disqualification Page (for <$250K revenue)

**Header**: We're Not the Right Fit — Yet.

Based on your revenue, The Genius Club isn't the right move for you right now. Our program is built for founders making $250K+ who are actively fundraising.

**Here's what we'd recommend instead:**
- Focus on hitting $250K in annual revenue first
- Build your core product-market fit
- When you're ready, come back — we'll be here

No hard feelings. This filter exists because we want every member to get real results, and that starts with being at the right stage.
