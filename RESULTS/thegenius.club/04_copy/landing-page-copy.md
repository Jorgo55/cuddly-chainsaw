### SECTION 2: Problem Agitation

**Header**: You've Done Everything Right. Except One Thing.

Your business is profitable. You've built a real product with real customers. You have revenue that most startups would kill for.

And yet — investor after investor keeps saying the same thing:

*"Really interesting. Let me bring it to the team."*

Then silence.

You've had 10+ meetings. You've redesigned the pitch deck. Twice. Maybe three times. You've networked, applied to accelerators, burned through warm intros.

Nothing changes.

**Here's what nobody is telling you:**

The pitch isn't why they're saying no.

---

### SECTION 3: The Reframe

**Header**: Investors Don't Fund Pitches. They Fund Machines.

Every investor you've met has looked past your slides and evaluated the business behind them.

They're checking:
- Can this company run without the founder in every meeting?
- Are there real systems, or just one person holding everything together?
- Would this business survive a bad quarter, or collapse under its own weight?

If the answer is "it depends on me" — that's the reason they pass. Not the pitch. Not the market. Not the timing.

**Your business is a "spaghetti mess" in their eyes. And no pitch deck fixes that.**

### SECTION 5: The Mechanism

**Header**: The Business Infrastructure Audit

Most founders spend months polishing their pitch when the real problem is what investors see behind it.

The Infrastructure Audit evaluates your business on the same dimensions investors actually use:

- **Founder Dependency Score** — what happens if you disappear for 90 days?
- **Operational Repeatability** — can your team execute without you in every decision?
- **Investor Red Flag Map** — the specific structural gaps causing "soft nos"
- **Team Depth Assessment** — real org chart or founder wearing every hat?
- **Scale Readiness** — can your business absorb capital without collapsing?

On your free call, we run a mini-audit and show you exactly where the gaps are.

No pitch deck review. No generic advice. The real diagnosis.

### SECTION 6: Who This Is For

**Header**: This Is For You If:

- You're making $250K–$2M/year in profit
- You've had 10+ investor meetings with zero term sheets
- You've been told "not quite ready" but nobody explains what's missing
- You've spent money on pitch deck consultants and it changed nothing
- You're running the business AND trying to fundraise and both are suffering
- You know something deeper is broken but you're too deep in it to see it

**This is NOT for you if:**

- You're pre-revenue (we can't help yet)
- You're looking for a pitch deck redesign (that's not what we do)
- You want someone to hand you money without fixing the foundation first

## Video Script (3 Minutes)

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**
"If you're a founder making $250K or more and you've had 10 or more investor meetings with nothing to show for it — this is the most important 3 minutes you'll watch this month."

**[0:15-0:45] Problem**
"Here's what's happening: You're pitching. You're getting 'really interesting, let me bring it to the team.' Then silence. Maybe you've redesigned the deck. Maybe you've hired a consultant. Maybe you've been told to 'refine the narrative.' And nothing changes. The meetings keep happening. The checks don't."

**[0:45-1:15] Reframe**
"I've spent 23 years working with founders — some of whom went on to IPO. And here's what I've learned: investors don't say no to pitches. They say no to businesses. Specifically, they say no to businesses that can't survive without the founder running everything. They call it 'founder dependency risk.' And it's probably the real reason you're getting 'soft nos.'"

**[1:15-1:45] Mechanism**
"We built something called the Business Infrastructure Audit. It evaluates your business on the exact same dimensions investors use — founder dependency, operational repeatability, team depth, financial infrastructure. The stuff behind the pitch deck. The stuff nobody else looks at."

**[1:45-2:15] What They Get**
"On a free call with our team, we run a mini version of this audit on your business. You walk away knowing exactly what investors see when they look at your company — and exactly what's stopping them from writing the check. No pitch deck review. No generic advice. Just the truth."

**[2:15-2:45] Filter + CTA**
"This is for founders making $250K or more per year who are serious about getting funded. If that's you, book the call below. It's 30 minutes. It's free. And it's the most honest conversation you'll have about your business this year."

**[2:45-3:00] Close**
"Stop polishing the pitch. Start fixing what's behind it."
