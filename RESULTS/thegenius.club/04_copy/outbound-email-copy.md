## Email 1: The Opener (Day 1)

### Subject Line Options (Test 3)
1. **Your 10th Investor Meeting.**
2. **Quick question about [Company Name]'s fundraise**
3. **The real reason investors say no**

### Body

Hi {first_name},

Most founders think a "no" from an investor is a pitch problem.

After 23 years working with founders who went on to IPO, I can tell you — it's usually an infrastructure problem.

VCs don't invest in "spaghetti messes." They invest in machines. Businesses with real systems, real teams, and real operations that don't collapse if the founder takes a vacation.

We built a 3-minute audit that shows you exactly where your business red-lines in the eyes of an investor.

P.S. This isn't a pitch deck review. We don't touch the deck. We look at what's behind it.

## Email 2: The Follow-Up (Day 4)

### Subject Line Options
1. **re: Your 10th Investor Meeting.**
2. **The gap between profitable and fundable**
3. **What investors see that you don't**

### Body

Hi {first_name},

Quick follow-up.

Last week I sent you a note about why investors might be passing on your business. Wanted to share the #1 pattern I see:

**Founder dependency.**

You're making money. Business is growing. But if you disappeared for 90 days, the whole thing stalls. Investors see that in the first 15 minutes of due diligence.

The fix isn't a better deck. It's better infrastructure.

We run a free 30-minute audit that shows you exactly where the dependency lives — and how to fix it before your next investor meeting.

## Email 3: The Reframe (Day 8)

### Subject Line Options
1. **Stop fixing the pitch**
2. **This is why your 3rd consultant didn't work either**
3. **What funded startups have that you don't**

### Body

Hi {first_name},

I've noticed a pattern with founders in the $250K-$2M range:

They spend $5K-$15K on pitch deck consultants. The deck looks amazing. Investors still pass.

Then they think: "I just need to get in front of MORE investors."

So they do. 10 more meetings. 10 more "soft nos."

The pitch was never the problem. Neither was the volume.

Investors evaluate the business behind the deck: operational systems, team depth, founder dependency, scalability. If those don't pass, no slide fixes it.

That's what our Infrastructure Audit reveals. Free. 30 minutes. The diagnosis nobody else gives.

P.S. We've worked with 23+ founders who went from "unfundable" to funded. The starting point was always the same: find out what investors actually see.

## Email 4: The Breakup (Day 12)

### Subject Line Options
1. **Last note from me**
2. **Closing the loop**
3. **One last thing before I stop emailing**

### Body

Hi {first_name},

This is my last email.

If you're a founder making $250K+ and you've been hearing "not yet" from investors — we built a free audit that shows you the real reason.

Not a pitch deck review. Not generic fundraising advice. A diagnostic that evaluates your business through the investor's lens: founder dependency, operational systems, team depth, scalability.

30 minutes. Free. On Google Meet.

If it's not for you, no worries. But if you've had 5+ investor meetings with no term sheet, this is the most useful 30 minutes you'll spend this month.

## Per-Avatar Variations (Optional — For Segmented Sends)

### Red-Liner Variation (Insert After Email 1 Opener)

**Subject**: Your company is profitable. Are you?

**Body**:
Hi {first_name},

You're making $250K+. Running a real business. Real team. Real customers.

But here's the honest question: when's the last time you took a full week off?

If the answer makes you uncomfortable — that's the same thing making investors uncomfortable.

They see a business that runs on one person's nervous system. And they know that doesn't scale.

We can show you exactly where the dependency lives — and how to fix it. Free 30-minute audit.

### Prisoner Variation

**Subject**: Your pitch deck is fine. Your business isn't.

**Body**:
Hi {first_name},

If you've had 10+ investor meetings and every one ended with "really interesting" followed by silence — I have news:

The deck isn't the problem.

Investors are rejecting the business behind the deck. The operations. The team depth. The founder dependency.

We built an Infrastructure Audit that shows you exactly what they see and never tell you.

Free. 30 minutes. No deck review.

### Bottleneck Variation

**Subject**: What happens to {company_name} if you can't work for 90 days?

**Body**:
Hi {first_name},

That question is what every investor asks — some version of it — in the first meeting.

If the answer is "everything stops" — that's your entire fundraising problem in one sentence.

It's not the pitch. It's not the market. It's founder dependency.

The Infrastructure Audit measures your Founder Dependency Score and maps the exact fixes. Free. 30 minutes.
