### Bonus Video Script (2 Minutes)

**[0:00-0:20] Context**
"Hey — congrats on booking the call. Most founders never take this step. They just keep polishing the deck and hoping the next meeting will be different. You're already ahead of them."

**[0:20-0:50] Set Expectations**
"Here's what to expect: this call is going to be direct. We're not going to tell you your pitch is great and wish you luck. We're going to look at your business through the same lens investors use — and tell you exactly what they see. That might be uncomfortable. But it's the most valuable conversation you'll have this quarter."

**[0:50-1:20] How to Prepare**
"To get the most out of it, come ready to be honest about three things: One — how your business actually operates day-to-day. Not the polished version. The real one. Two — what your team can and can't do without you. Three — what investors have actually said in their feedback, even the parts that stung."

**[1:20-1:50] Motivation**
"The founders who get the most from this call are the ones who stop protecting their ego for 30 minutes and let someone look under the hood. That's it. Be open. Be honest. And you'll leave with something nobody else has given you: the real reason investors keep saying no."

**[1:50-2:00] Close**
"See you on the call."

## Section 4: Show-Up Motivation

**Header**: Why This Call Matters

**87% of founders** who get rejected by investors never find out the real reason.

They get "soft nos" — polite emails that say nothing. "Great product, but not the right fit." "Interesting space, but we're passing for now."

Your audit call is the first time someone will tell you what those emails actually mean.

This is not a sales pitch. It's a diagnostic. Show up, be honest, and you'll leave knowing exactly what to fix.
