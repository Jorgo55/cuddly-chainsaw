# Creative Audit: Ad Copy — Expert Bottleneck

**Source**: `RESULTS/thegenius.club/04_copy/ad-copy-expert-bottleneck.md`
**Auditing**: Ad 1 (Primary — "Investors don't fund founders. They fund machines.") as representative.

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: PASS

**Primary Bottleneck**: This avatar's deepest fear (psychological inability to let go) is addressed in the ad but needs the "psychology + systems" combo made even more explicit. The copy currently leans more "systems" than "wiring."

**Trust Score**: 78%
**Weighted Radar Average**: 8.15/10

**Top Fixes (ranked by lift)**:
1. Add "Founder Dependency Score" as a named deliverable in the CTA line → gives them a tangible, scoreable metric
2. Acknowledge the COO failure explicitly in one variation: "Your last hire failed because you never built the system first" → validates experience
3. Test "90 days" as a hook element: "What happens to your company if you can't work for 90 days?" is the strongest hook — test as video opener

## Persona Panel (Condensed)

**Ezra (25%)**: 8/10 — "Investors fund machines, not founders. Got it. Free audit. Simple." Slightly longer body text than other avatar ads — could trim.

**Sophia (30%)**: 7/10 — "Founder Dependency Score sounds real. But who validated it? Where's the proof this diagnostic actually predicts investor behavior?"

**Paula (20%)**: 8/10 — "Free call. But this is hitting deep — 'your business can't survive without you' is a scary message. I'd click cautiously, not eagerly."

**Devin (15%)**: 8/10 — "Dependency Score is a metric I can track. If they can show me my score and what to improve, that's concrete ROI. I'd click."

**Avery (10%)**: 8/10 — "Building a machine that runs without me — that's the CEO identity I want. Not the firefighter. This repositions me."

## Hook-by-Hook Assessment

| Hook | Ezra | Sophia | Stop-Scroll? | Verdict |
|------|:----:|:------:|:------------:|---------|
| "Investors don't fund founders. They fund machines." | 9 | 7 | YES | PASS — identity challenge, philosophical |
| "You've been told to delegate. You've tried. It didn't work." | 8 | 8 | YES | PASS — validates failure, strong Sophia appeal |
| "Your COO quit because your business has no systems — it has you." | 9 | 7 | YES | PASS — hyper-specific pain narrative |
| "What happens to your company if you can't work for 90 days?" | 9 | 8 | YES | PASS — fear + investor lens, best overall |
| "10 meetings. 10 'soft nos.' Business can't survive without you." | 8 | 7 | YES | PASS — bridge to general ICP |

**Top 3 to test first**: Hook 4, Hook 3, Hook 2

## Fix Plan

### Fix #1: Dependency Score as Named CTA
**What to change**: CTA variant: "Find Out Your Founder Dependency Score — Free"
**Why**: Gives the click a tangible output. The Bottleneck avatar loves metrics and scores. Makes the audit feel diagnostic, not salesy.
**Expected lift**: Devin +1, CTR +10-15%

### Fix #2: Psychology Acknowledgment
**What to change**: Add 1 line in body text: "This isn't about delegation tips. It's about fixing the wiring that keeps you at the center — then building systems that match your standard."
**Why**: Every other solution this avatar tried was systems-only. The psychology angle is THE differentiator. Make it explicit.
**Expected lift**: Belief Break +1, Relevance +0.5

### Fix #3: Video with "90 Days" Hook
**What to change**: 15-second video: "What happens to your company if you can't work for 90 days? If the answer terrifies you — that's exactly what investors see."
**Why**: This is the one question that stops this avatar cold. It's what VCs literally ask. Video delivery hits harder than text.
**Expected lift**: Hook engagement +20%, CTR boost
