# Creative Audit: Ad Copy — Pitch-Deck Prisoner

**Source**: `RESULTS/thegenius.club/04_copy/ad-copy-pitch-deck-prisoner.md`
**Auditing**: Ad 1 (Primary — "Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no.") as representative.

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: PASS

**Primary Bottleneck**: This avatar has the strongest ego barrier. The copy correctly calls out the false solution (pitch deck consultants) but must be careful not to condescend. Tone is currently well-calibrated — assertive without being aggressive.

**Trust Score**: 77%
**Weighted Radar Average**: 8.20/10

**Top Fixes (ranked by lift)**:
1. Add the "14 things investors evaluate" as a curiosity hook in one ad variation → gives Sophia something concrete
2. Include a "before/after" visual concept note: polished deck vs. messy org chart → visual pattern interrupt
3. Test "the resentment mirror" (Hook 4) as a standalone short-form video — highest emotional charge for this avatar

## Persona Panel (Condensed)

**Ezra (25%)**: 9/10 — "Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no. Clear. Direct. I get it in 2 seconds."

**Sophia (30%)**: 7/10 — "OK, so what IS the reason? The BIA concept is interesting. But prove it — show me a founder whose pitch deck was fine but their business infrastructure was the real blocker."

**Paula (20%)**: 8/10 — "Free call. No pitch deck review. Low risk. But this is challenging my worldview — I'll click out of curiosity, not certainty."

**Devin (15%)**: 8/10 — "If investors evaluate 14 things beyond the deck, I want to know what those 14 things are. This gives me an edge. I'll click."

**Avery (10%)**: 7/10 — "The reframe is smart. Being part of a group that knows what investors REALLY want — that's a status upgrade."

## Hook-by-Hook Assessment

| Hook | Ezra | Sophia | Stop-Scroll? | Verdict |
|------|:----:|:------:|:------------:|---------|
| "Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no." | 9 | 7 | YES | PASS — strongest pattern interrupt for this avatar |
| "10+ investor meetings. 10+ 'soft nos.' Still think it's the deck?" | 9 | 8 | YES | PASS — hyper-specific pain, high scroll-stop |
| "For founders making $250K+ who can't close a round." | 8 | 6 | MAYBE | PASS but weaker — filter-first approach |
| "That startup with half your traction just raised $3M. Here's why." | 8 | 7 | YES | PASS — resentment trigger is powerful |
| "You've spent $10K+ on pitch consultants. Want to know why none worked?" | 9 | 9 | YES | PASS — sunk cost + curiosity, Sophia loves this |

**Top 3 to test first**: Hook 1, Hook 5, Hook 2

## Fix Plan

### Fix #1: "14 Dimensions" Curiosity Hook
**What to change**: Test ad variation: "Investors evaluate 14 things before they look at a single slide. Most founders fail on 9."
**Why**: Gives Sophia a concrete, testable claim. Creates curiosity gap. The number feels researched.
**Expected lift**: Sophia +1, Devin +0.5

### Fix #2: Visual Before/After Concept
**What to change**: Create image: polished pitch deck (left) vs. messy org chart with founder in every box (right). Caption: "What you're fixing vs. what investors actually see."
**Why**: Visual pattern interrupt that mirrors the copy's core message. Strong for feed and Stories.
**Expected lift**: Ezra +0.5 (instant comprehension), Emotion +0.5

### Fix #3: Ego-Safe Language Audit
**What to change**: Review all variations for any line that says "your business is broken" — replace with "the structure behind the pitch needs work"
**Why**: This avatar's ego is the barrier. Systemic framing ("investors evaluate these dimensions") is safer than personal framing ("your business sucks").
**Expected lift**: Conversion rate on Prisoner segment +10-15%
