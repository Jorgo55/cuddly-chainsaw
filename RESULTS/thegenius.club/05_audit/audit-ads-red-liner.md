# Creative Audit: Ad Copy — Red-Liner

**Source**: `RESULTS/thegenius.club/04_copy/ad-copy-red-liner.md`
**Auditing**: Ad 1 (Primary — "Your company is profitable. You're not.") as representative. Notes on other hooks included.

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: PASS

**Primary Bottleneck**: Same as landing page — no contexted proof/testimonial in the ad. Authority claim alone. Mechanism mention is brief in ad format.

**Trust Score**: 75%
**Weighted Radar Average**: 8.10/10

**Top Fixes (ranked by lift)**:
1. Add a micro-proof line: "Built from 23 years working with IPO founders" → earns authority in limited space
2. Test video format with Andy delivering Hook 1 as talking head → face = trust, hook is strong enough for cold scroll
3. Consider adding "(Free)" next to CTA → removes last friction for cold traffic

## Persona Panel (Condensed)

**Ezra (25%)**: 9/10 — "Your company is profitable. You're not." Instantly clear. One message. CTA obvious. Would stop scrolling.

**Sophia (30%)**: 7/10 — "BIA concept mentioned but not enough proof in ad format. 'Infrastructure Audit' sounds real though — named tool. I'd click to learn more, not to commit."

**Paula (20%)**: 8/10 — "Free audit call. No commitment. Low risk. I'll click."

**Devin (15%)**: 7/10 — "Outcome is clear: find out why investors say no. But what specifically do I get from this call? The BIA breakdown helps. Would click to evaluate further."

**Avery (10%)**: 7/10 — "$250K+ filter signals this is for serious founders. The pain mirror hook is raw but honest — that's the brand identity they'd want."

## Hook-by-Hook Assessment

| Hook | Ezra | Sophia | Stop-Scroll? | Verdict |
|------|:----:|:------:|:------------:|---------|
| "Your company is profitable. You're not." | 9 | 7 | YES | PASS — best overall hook, identity disruption |
| "Pitch deck consultants fix slides. We fix why investors say no." | 8 | 8 | YES | PASS — strong Sophia angle, enemy creation |
| "For founders making $250K+ who can't stop working" | 8 | 6 | MAYBE | REVISE — good filter but less pattern-breaking |
| "You don't need more meetings. You need to become the company they can't say no to." | 7 | 7 | MAYBE | PASS — aspirational, less urgent |
| "You've been told 'no' by 10 investors. None told you the real reason." | 9 | 8 | YES | PASS — mystery + specificity combo |

**Top 3 to test first**: Hook 1, Hook 5, Hook 2

## Fix Plan

### Fix #1: Micro-Proof Injection
**What to change**: Add "Built from 23 years working with IPO founders" after the BIA mention
**Why**: Ads are proof-starved by nature. One authority line bridges the gap.
**Expected lift**: Sophia +1, Believability +0.5

### Fix #2: Video Format Test
**What to change**: Shoot 15-30 sec video with Andy delivering Hook 1 cold
**Why**: Face + voice = trust multiplier on cold traffic. Hook is punchy enough for video.
**Expected lift**: Trust +10%, CTR improvement expected

### Fix #3: "(Free)" in CTA
**What to change**: "Book Free Audit Call" → already says free, but ensure "Free" is bold/emphasized in ad
**Why**: Cold traffic needs zero-risk signal repeated
**Expected lift**: Paula +0.5, click-through rate +5-10%
