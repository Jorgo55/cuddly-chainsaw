**Source**: `RESULTS/thegenius.club/04_copy/booking-page-copy.md`
**Traffic**: Warm (clicked through from landing page)
**Conversion Event**: Complete booking

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: PASS

**Primary Bottleneck**: The qualification questions are well-structured but Question 4 could reveal avatar type more precisely. Minor optimization opportunity.

**Trust Score**: 82%
**Weighted Radar Average**: 8.40/10

**Top Fixes (ranked by lift)**:
1. Add a "What Others Are Saying" micro-section below calendar (when testimonials available) → reduces last-second booking friction
2. Question 4 should map explicitly to avatar buckets for salesperson prep notes
3. Add estimated wait time for booking slots ("Most founders book within 48 hours") → creates urgency without pressure

## Persona Panel (Condensed)

**Ezra**: 9/10 — Questions are short, calendar is clear, process is explained. No friction.
**Sophia**: 8/10 — "What Happens After You Book" section earns trust. Clear process = credibility.
**Paula**: 8/10 — Free call confirmed, Google Meet (no install), reschedule option visible. Safe.
**Devin**: 8/10 — Questions show they're preparing specifically for MY business. That's professional.
**Avery**: 7/10 — Functional page, not aspirational. Fine for this stage — the sell already happened.

## Fix Plan

### Fix #1: Avatar Mapping for Sales Team
**What to change**: Add internal mapping notes (not visible to user) so CRM tags the lead based on Q4 answer: "getting rejected" → Prisoner, "killing me to do both" → Red-Liner
**Why**: Salesperson can calibrate the "you're not ready" reveal based on avatar type
**Expected lift**: Call conversion +5-10%

### Fix #2: Disqualification Page Tone
**What to change**: Current soft rejection page is good. Add: "Want to know when you're ready? Leave your email and we'll check in when you hit $250K."
**Why**: Captures pre-qualified leads for future — they'll grow into the ICP
**Expected lift**: Future pipeline growth
