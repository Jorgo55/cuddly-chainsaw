## Cross-Creative Patterns

### Systemic Strength
- **Clarity is consistently high (8-9)** across all creatives — the "one message, one CTA" discipline is strong
- **Hooks are consistently strong (8-9)** — the avatar research paid off in relevant, pattern-breaking hooks
- **$250K+ filter works as both qualifying tool AND trust signal** — appears in every creative, never feels forced

### Systemic Weakness
- **Believability ceiling at 7 across all creatives** — the first-cohort proof gap affects everything. No fix except time + first members.
- **Trust scores cluster at 75-83%** — solid but not exceptional. The gap is always the same: no case studies, no testimonials.
- **Andy's authority is the ONLY proof asset** — if that claim is unverified or challenged, the entire trust structure weakens.

## Priority Fixes (Across All Creatives)

| # | Fix | Affects | Impact | Effort |
|:-:|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Document first 10 members from Day 1** — video testimonials at Week 4, case studies at Month 3, before/after BIA scores | ALL creatives | Raises Believability from 7 to 8-9 across the board | HIGH (ongoing) |
| 2 | **Verify Andy's credentials** — exact years, exact number of IPO founders, what "$200M ad spend" refers to | ALL creatives | Prevents catastrophic trust failure if challenged | LOW (one conversation) |
| 3 | **BIA sample/demo output** — create a visual sample of what the audit looks like | Landing page, ads | Makes mechanism tangible instead of theoretical | MEDIUM |
| 4 | **Soften unverified stats** — "87% of founders" on TY page, "23+ founders" in Email 3 | TY page, outbound email | Prevents Sophia flags | LOW |
| 5 | **Andy talking-head videos** for top 3 hooks per avatar | All ads | Face + voice = trust multiplier on cold traffic | MEDIUM |
| 6 | **Ego-safe language review** for Prisoner avatar | Prisoner ads, landing page | Prevents ego-barrier rejection | LOW |

## Persona Performance (Across All Creatives)

| Persona | Average Score | Strongest Creative | Weakest Creative | Systemic Note |
|---------|:------------:|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Ezra** | 8.7/10 | Booking (9) | Email (8) | Consistently strong — clarity discipline is excellent |
| **Sophia** | 7.3/10 | Booking (8) | Ads-RL (7) | The bottleneck persona. Always wants more proof. First-cohort gap. |
| **Paula** | 8.0/10 | TY Page (9) | Email (7) | "Free call" removes risk. Cold email inherently lower. |
| **Devin** | 7.9/10 | Booking (8) | Ads-RL (7) | BIA sub-components help. Wants more ROI math. |
| **Avery** | 7.0/10 | Ads-EB (8) | Email (6) | Lowest across the board. Identity play is in the brand, not the copy. Design execution will determine Avery's final score. |

## Final Verdict

**ALL 7 CREATIVES PASS.**

The system is launch-ready with the noted proof gap (first-cohort problem). The critical path to improving all scores is:

1. Launch → get first members
2. Document everything from Day 1
3. At Week 4: first video testimonials
4. At Month 3: first full case studies with before/after BIA scores
5. Re-audit all creatives with real proof → expect Believability to jump to 8-9

**Proceed to Step 6 (Funnel Build).**
