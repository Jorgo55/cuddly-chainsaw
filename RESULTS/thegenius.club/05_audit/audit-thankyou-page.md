# Creative Audit: Thank You Page

**Source**: `RESULTS/thegenius.club/04_copy/thankyou-page-copy.md`
**Traffic**: Hot (just booked a call)
**Conversion Event**: Show up for the call

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict**: PASS

**Primary Bottleneck**: The bonus video script is strong but the "87% of founders never find out the real reason" stat needs sourcing or softening. Currently PLAUSIBLE — not a deal-breaker but Sophia would notice.

**Trust Score**: 83%
**Weighted Radar Average**: 8.35/10

**Top Fixes (ranked by lift)**:
1. Soften "87% of founders" to "Most founders" unless stat is sourced → prevents Sophia flag
2. Add countdown to call ("Your call is in X days") with dynamic content if tech supports it → increases anticipation
3. Social proof section (placeholder) is correctly hidden until real testimonials exist — good discipline

## Persona Panel (Condensed)

**Ezra**: 9/10 — Clear confirmation, clear next steps, short bonus video (2 min). No confusion about what happens.
**Sophia**: 8/10 — "Come ready to be honest about three things" in the video script is a strong credibility signal. The "87%" stat is unverified — soften it.
**Paula**: 9/10 — Logistics are crystal clear. Reschedule option included. "What happens next" removes all unknowns. Very safe feeling.
**Devin**: 8/10 — Knows exactly what the call covers. Prep instructions are practical. The "be honest" framing signals this isn't fluff.
**Avery**: 7/10 — Functional. The video script has a good line: "You're already ahead of them" — light identity boost.

## Fix Plan

### Fix #1: Source or Soften the Stat
**What to change**: "87% of founders never find out the real reason" → "Most founders never find out the real reason investors say no"
**Why**: Unverified stat triggers Sophia. "Most" is equally effective and doesn't require proof.
**Expected lift**: Trust +3% (prevents a breaker)

### Fix #2: Dynamic Countdown
**What to change**: Add "Your call is in [X] days" with countdown if tech supports
**Why**: Creates anticipation and reduces no-shows
**Expected lift**: Show rate +5-10%
