## Week 1: Social Proof / Transformation

**Subject**: What $250K founders get wrong about fundraising
**Send Day**: Tuesday

---

Most founders making $250K+ think their fundraising problem is one of these:
- Bad pitch deck
- Wrong investors
- Bad timing
- Not enough meetings

It's none of those.

After 23 years working with founders — some who went on to IPO — the #1 reason investors say no is the same every time:

**The business can't survive without the founder.**

That's it. Everything else is a symptom.

The Infrastructure Audit identifies exactly where your founder dependency lives — and what to fix first.

## Week 2: Education / Myth Bust

**Subject**: The 3 things investors evaluate before they look at your deck
**Send Day**: Tuesday

---

You spend weeks perfecting the pitch deck. Investors spend 5 minutes on it.

Here's what they actually evaluate first:

**1. Founder Dependency Score**
What happens if the founder disappears for 90 days? If the business stalls — that's the first red flag.

**2. Operational Repeatability**
Are core processes documented and executable by someone other than the founder? Or does everything live in one person's head?

**3. Team Depth**
Is the org chart real — or is it the founder wearing 8 hats?

If any of these fail, the pitch is irrelevant. The investor already has their answer.

## Week 3: Process Demo / Framework

**Subject**: How the Infrastructure Audit works (2 min read)
**Send Day**: Tuesday

---

People ask what the Infrastructure Audit actually looks at.

Here's the framework:

**Layer 1: Operations**
- Are core processes documented?
- Can someone other than the founder execute them?
- What happens when a key person is out?

**Layer 2: Founder Psychology**
- Where does the founder struggle to let go?
- Which tasks are revenue-critical vs. ego-critical?
- What's the real cost of their involvement in every decision?

**Layer 3: Investor Lens**
- Does this business look like a "machine" or a "mess"?
- Would a VC fund this as-is?
- What are the specific red flags in due diligence?

On the free call, we walk through a mini-version of this with your actual business.

**Send Day**: Thursday

---

P.S. If you're making $250K+ and you've had 5+ investor meetings with no term sheet, this is the most useful half-hour you'll spend this month. No exaggeration.
