# Founder Archetypes — The Genius Club

This document describes the three founder archetypes used in the Business Infrastructure Audit. Use this to provide detailed, specific assessments when a founder matches an archetype.

# Archetype 1: The Red-Liner (Successful but Shattering)

## Core Pattern
Making money, losing everything else. Running a company that's slowly running the founder into the ground. The business is profitable but the founder is NOT — physically, mentally, relationally.

## Demographics
- Age: 32-42
- Revenue: $500K-$2M/yr profit
- Team: 5-25 employees
- Stage: 2-5 years in, product-market fit proven, operationally fragile
- Working: 65-80 hour weeks
- Industries: B2B SaaS, Fintech, AI Infrastructure, High-Ticket Agencies

## How to Identify This Archetype
- Strong revenue but founder works insane hours
- Business collapses without them — they ARE the infrastructure
- Haven't seriously attempted fundraising (too busy surviving) or tried half-heartedly
- Partner/spouse has expressed concern about sustainability
- Physical stress symptoms: broken sleep, anxiety, drinking more
- When asked "what happens if you disappear for 2 weeks" the answer is some version of "everything falls apart"
- When asked "what only you can do" the answer is "basically everything"

## Their Pain Points (Use These in Assessment)
- Company is profitable but founder can't extract themselves — every dollar of profit requires a dollar of energy
- No SOPs, no delegation framework, no middle management — founder IS the business
- Nervous system is fried — sleep broken, short-tempered, health declining
- Can't fundraise AND run the company simultaneously — physically impossible
- Spent $15K-$30K on failed fundraising attempts already
- Impostor syndrome in investor meetings despite real revenue

## Their False Beliefs
- "If I just work harder, I'll break through" — working harder IS the disease
- "Investors reject me because my company isn't big enough" — they reject because founder IS the company (single point of failure)
- "I can't slow down or everything collapses" — true right now, which is exactly the structural problem
- "Getting funded will solve my burnout" — no, getting funded without fixing infrastructure adds investor pressure to a breaking system

## What Investors See
- Single point of failure risk (dealbreaker)
- No operational scalability
- Burnout risk = flight risk
- The company has revenue but no machine — it's a very expensive job, not an investable business

## Their 3 Priority Fixes
1. Document the 6 processes that cause 80% of firefighting — this week, not "someday"
2. Identify 3 decisions you make daily that someone else could make at 80% quality — delegate them with a written decision tree
3. Build a "bus test" plan: if you were gone for 30 days, who does what? If the answer is "nobody," that's your investor red flag

## Emotional Trigger That Resonates
"You're profitable but not fundable. Not because of your numbers — because investors won't fund a business that dies when the founder stops."

## Voice Line (How They Sound)
"I've got a company doing seven figures, a team that depends on me, and ten investors who told me I'm 'not quite ready.' I can't keep going like this but I can't stop either. I don't need another pitch deck. I need someone to look under the hood and tell me what's actually broken."

# Archetype 2: The Pitch-Deck Prisoner (Keeps Polishing Slides)

## Core Pattern
Stuck in a loop: tweak deck → pitch → get "soft no" → tweak deck → repeat. Believes the presentation is the problem when the BUSINESS is the problem. Has had 10+ investor meetings with zero checks.

## Demographics
- Age: 30-42
- Revenue: $250K-$2M/yr profit
- Funding status: Stuck at Seed/Pre-Seed for 18+ months
- Team: 5-25 employees
- Investor meetings: 10+ with "soft nos"
- Money spent on pitch consultants: $6K-$15K across 2-3 different consultants

## How to Identify This Archetype
- Has had many investor meetings — all ended in polite passes
- Has hired 2+ pitch deck consultants or taken fundraising bootcamps
- Believes "the right pitch will unlock the right check"
- Gets contradictory feedback from VCs (one says great product, another says market too small)
- Posts about "fundraising lessons" on LinkedIn but never mentions the rejections
- Oscillates between manic optimism after a "good meeting" and quiet despair after ghosting
- When asked "what worries investors" they focus on presentation, narrative, or pitch mechanics — not operations
- When asked "what only you can do" they talk about vision and product, not systems

## Their Pain Points (Use These in Assessment)
- Every VC gives different feedback — creating analysis paralysis
- Spent $6K-$15K on pitch consultants with zero ROI — deck looks great, still gets "no"
- Identity is fused with the fundraise — every rejection is personal
- Revenue plateau without growth capital, stuck in self-funding loop
- Sees objectively worse startups announce funding rounds on LinkedIn
- 18+ months in the fundraising hamster wheel — what was supposed to be 3 months

## Their False Beliefs
- "The pitch IS the product" — thinks fundraising is a presentation skill problem
- "Investors just don't get it" — externalizes every rejection
- "Once I get funded, I'll fix the operations" — capital amplifies whatever already exists, including the mess
- "Other funded startups aren't better than mine" — can't accept funded competitors might have investable infrastructure
- "I just need more meetings / warm intros / the right VC" — volume doesn't fix a 0% conversion rate

## What Investors See
- Beautiful deck hiding operational chaos
- Founder who can't articulate business fundamentals beyond the pitch
- No systems, no documentation, founder in every role
- A company that looks investable on slides but falls apart under due diligence questions
- "Great product, weak business" — the polite version of "not fundable"

## Their 3 Priority Fixes
1. Stop pitching for 30 days. Seriously. The next meeting will end the same way if nothing changes behind the deck.
2. Write down every piece of feedback you've gotten from investors. Look for the pattern — it's almost certainly about operations, team, or founder dependency, not the pitch itself.
3. Answer this honestly: "What happens to my company if I can't work for 90 days?" If the answer terrifies you, THAT'S what investors are rejecting. Fix it.

## Emotional Trigger That Resonates
"Your pitch deck isn't why investors said no. You've redesigned it 4 times. Hired 3 consultants. Rehearsed until you could pitch in your sleep. And you're still getting ghosted after 'great meetings.' The deck was never the problem."

## Voice Line (How They Sound)
"I've had 12 investor meetings this quarter. Every single one said they loved the product. Every single one passed. If one more person tells me to 'refine the narrative,' I'm going to lose it. I KNOW the deck is good. I don't know what the hell they actually want."

# Archetype 3: The Expert Bottleneck (Smartest Person in a Burning Room)

## Core Pattern
Built a profitable business but they ARE the business. Technically brilliant, can't delegate because quality drops. Investors explicitly flag "founder-dependency risk." Revenue ceiling equals founder's personal capacity.

## Demographics
- Age: 32-44
- Revenue: $250K-$2M/yr (business profit)
- Team: 5-25 employees, high turnover
- Working: 65-80 hours/week, 40% on tasks only they can do (because they never built systems)
- Background: Often ex-FAANG or ex-consulting, technically gifted
- Industries: B2B SaaS, Fintech, AI Infrastructure

## How to Identify This Archetype
- KNOWS they're the bottleneck — says it explicitly
- Has tried to delegate and it "didn't work" — output came back at 60% quality
- May have hired a COO/ops person who quit or was fired within 6-12 months
- Tried EOS/Traction, got 30% implemented before reverting to founder-control
- Investors have literally said "founder-dependency risk" to their face
- When asked "what happens if you disappear" they describe specific quality failures, not general chaos
- When asked "what only you can do" they name a specific technical or client-facing skill
- When asked what worries investors they say some version of "that it's all me"

## Their Pain Points (Use These in Assessment)
- Investors explicitly flag founder-dependency as the dealbreaker
- Revenue ceiling is their personal capacity — can't grow beyond what they personally touch
- Every delegation attempt failed because output didn't meet their standard → they took it back
- Hired a COO at $150K+ who quit because founder overrode every decision
- No documented processes that work — started SOP docs 3 times, never finished
- Team turnover: good people join, realize nothing is documented, can't operate independently, leave
- Identity fused with being the indispensable expert — letting go feels like losing their purpose

## Their False Beliefs
- "If I just hire the right person, the problem solves itself" — it's a systems + psychology problem, not a hiring problem
- "I'll document processes when things calm down" — things never calm down BECAUSE there's no documentation
- "Nobody can do this as well as I can" — true today, only because they never built the system that enables 90% quality from others
- "Investors just don't understand my business model" — investors understand perfectly; they see a business that dies if the founder gets hit by a bus
- "Once we raise funding, I can hire the team to fix this" — investors won't fund a founder-dependent business, creating a catch-22

## What Investors See
- A very talented freelancer with employees, not a real company
- Total single-point-of-failure risk
- Team that can't function independently
- Revolving-door hiring (red flag for culture and systems)
- A founder who will burn out 18 months post-investment
- "Great operator, terrible CEO" — the uncomfortable truth

## Their 3 Priority Fixes
1. List every task you did this week. Tag each one: "only I can do this" vs. "I do this because I haven't built the system." Transfer ONE "hasn't built the system" task this week with a written quality checklist.
2. Record yourself doing your highest-value repeatable task (Loom, screen recording). That recording becomes the first real SOP. Imperfect is fine — it's infinitely better than tribal knowledge.
3. Set a "founder dependency test": don't touch Slack/email for 48 hours. What breaks? That's your priority list for systematization.

## Emotional Trigger That Resonates
"You've been told to delegate. You've tried. It didn't work. Here's why: you delegated tasks without building systems. You handed off work without quality gates, decision trees, or documentation. People failed because the instructions lived in your head. That's not a team problem — it's an infrastructure problem."

## Voice Line (How They Sound)
"I know I'm the bottleneck. I've read the books. I've heard the advice. But every time I hand something off, it comes back wrong. I've tried hiring a COO. I've tried documenting processes. Nothing sticks. And now investors are telling me my company is 'too founder-dependent' to fund."
