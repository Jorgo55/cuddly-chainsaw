# Business Infrastructure Audit (BIA) — Framework Reference

This document contains the BIA scoring framework, dimension definitions, and assessment logic used by The Genius Club.

---

# What Is the BIA

The Business Infrastructure Audit is a diagnostic framework that maps exactly where a founder's business breaks under scale — operationally, psychologically, and financially. It identifies the 3-5 infrastructure gaps that cause investor rejections before the pitch even matters.

## Core Insight

Pitch deck consultants fix slides.
Fundraising coaches fix delivery.
Accelerators fix market positioning.
Nobody fixes the business behind all of it.
The BIA does.

# The 5 BIA Dimensions

## 1. Founder Dependency Score

**What It Measures**: How much of the business dies if the founder disappears for 90 days.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- 1-2: Business stops entirely. No one else can make decisions, serve clients, or maintain operations.
- 3-4: Business survives 1-2 weeks in degraded mode. Key functions stall. Revenue declines immediately.
- 5-6: Business runs for 30 days but slowly degrades. Some functions are covered, others aren't.
- 7-8: Business operates normally for 60+ days. Most functions have owners. Founder handles strategy only.
- 9-10: Business runs indefinitely without founder in daily operations. Founder is CEO, not operator.

**Key Questions That Reveal Score**:
- "What happens to daily operations if you disappear for 2 weeks?"
- "How many Slack messages require YOUR response before someone else can act?"
- "When was the last time you took 5+ consecutive days off? What happened?"

**Red Flags for Investors**:
- Founder in every client meeting
- No second-in-command who can run a team meeting
- All key vendor/partner relationships are founder-to-person
- Emergency decisions require founder approval

## 2. Operational Repeatability Index

**What It Measures**: Percentage of core processes that are documented and executable by someone other than the founder.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- 1-2: Zero documented processes. Everything is tribal knowledge or founder-driven improvisation.
- 3-4: A few docs exist but are outdated or unused. Team asks founder for instructions on recurring tasks.
- 5-6: Core processes partially documented. Some team members can execute independently on routine work.
- 7-8: 70%+ of revenue-critical processes documented with quality standards. Team executes reliably.
- 9-10: Full operational playbook. New hires can onboard and execute without founder involvement.

**Key Questions That Reveal Score**:
- "If you hired someone tomorrow for your most critical operational role, how long until they're productive WITHOUT asking you questions?"
- "How many times this week did someone ask you 'how do we do X?' for something that should be routine?"

**Red Flags for Investors**:
- No onboarding documentation
- Key processes change based on who's doing them
- Quality is inconsistent across team members
- "Only [founder name] knows how that works"

## 3. Investor Red Flag Map

**What It Measures**: The specific structural issues a VC would flag in due diligence.

**Common Red Flags by Severity**:

Critical (Dealbreakers):
- Founder is single point of failure across operations, sales, AND product
- No financial infrastructure beyond basic bookkeeping
- Revenue entirely dependent on founder's personal relationships
- No clear org chart or role definitions

Serious (Yellow Flags):
- Key roles unfilled or filled by underqualified junior hires
- No documented processes for client delivery or product development
- Founder handles all customer escalations personally
- Cap table issues or unclear equity structure

Moderate (Fixable):
- Team is strong but founder still approves all decisions
- Processes exist informally but aren't documented
- Financial reporting exists but isn't investor-grade
- Some delegation happening but inconsistent

**Scoring**: Count critical flags (x3), serious flags (x2), moderate flags (x1). Subtract from 30. Normalize to 1-10 scale.

## 4. Team Depth Assessment

**What It Measures**: Whether the org chart has real people in real roles or just the founder wearing multiple hats.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- 1-2: Founder does everything. Team is junior executors who wait for instructions.
- 3-4: 1-2 capable team members but they can't operate without founder direction.
- 5-6: Small but functional team. Some independent decision-making. Key gaps in leadership.
- 7-8: Leadership layer exists. Team leads own their domains. Founder manages strategy.
- 9-10: Full management team. Each department has an owner. Founder is CEO, not manager.

**Key Questions That Reveal Score**:
- "Who makes decisions when you're not available?"
- "Do you have anyone on your team who could present to an investor on their area of the business?"
- "When was the last time you hired someone senior enough that they push back on your ideas?"

## 5. Scale Readiness Rating

**What It Measures**: Can this business absorb $1M in capital without collapsing under its own weight?

**What Investors Evaluate**:
- If you doubled revenue in 12 months, what would break first?
- Can the current team handle 2x the workload?
- Are systems in place to onboard new hires rapidly?
- Is there financial infrastructure to manage and report on investor capital?
- Does the product/service delivery scale with headcount or with founder hours?

**Scoring Criteria**:
- 1-2: Capital injection would cause chaos. No systems to deploy it effectively.
- 3-4: Could absorb small capital but would hit bottlenecks quickly. Hiring would expose ops gaps.
- 5-6: Could deploy capital into 1-2 areas effectively. Other areas would strain.
- 7-8: Ready for growth capital. Systems, team, and processes can handle 2x.
- 9-10: Fully scale-ready. Capital accelerates an already-working machine.

# Overall BIA Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Verdict | What It Means |
|:-----------:|---------|---------------|
| 40-50 | **Investor-Ready** | Business has real infrastructure. Fix minor gaps and start fundraising. |
| 30-39 | **Close But Not There** | Foundation exists but 2-3 critical gaps remain. 60-90 day fix timeline. |
| 20-29 | **Significant Work Needed** | Infrastructure is spotty. Founder-dependency is high. 90-120 day rebuild. |
| 10-19 | **Not Fundable Today** | Major structural gaps. Business runs on founder heroics. 4-6 month timeline. |
| 0-9 | **Pre-Infrastructure** | No systems, no team depth, total founder dependency. Needs foundational build. |

# How BIA Connects to Archetypes

| Archetype | Typical BIA Score | Weakest Dimensions | Strongest Dimensions |
|-----------|:-----------------:|--------------------|--------------------|
| Red-Liner | 15-25 | Founder Dependency (2-4), Operational Repeatability (2-4) | Scale Readiness (4-6 — revenue proves demand) |
| Pitch-Deck Prisoner | 18-28 | Investor Red Flags (3-5), Team Depth (3-5) | Scale Readiness (4-6 — product works) |
| Expert Bottleneck | 12-22 | Founder Dependency (1-3), Team Depth (2-4) | Operational Repeatability (3-5 — they know what the processes SHOULD be, just haven't systematized them) |

# The Genius Club — What It Is

The Genius Club is a 12-month membership for founders making $250K+ who keep getting "no" from investors. It uses the Business Infrastructure Audit to diagnose why investors actually say no, then builds the operational infrastructure that makes the business fundable.

## What's Included
- Full 14-dimension Business Infrastructure Audit
- Investor Red Flag Report (custom to their business)
- Founder Extraction Blueprint (delegation systems built to their standard)
- 90-Day Fundraising Prep Calendar
- Live calls with Andy Murphy (23 years working with 23+ IPO founders)
- Peer cohort of founders at the same revenue level
- Capital Connections — priority investor introductions after readiness is proven

## Two Tiers
- The Genius Club (Membership): $5,000 / 12 months
- The 90-Day Funding Machine (Accelerator): $10,000 / intensive 90-day sprint with weekly 1:1

## Key Differentiator
Every competitor fixes the pitch. The Genius Club fixes what's behind the pitch. The BIA evaluates a business through the same lens investors use — founder dependency, operational repeatability, team depth, financial infrastructure, and scalability. It reveals what investors see but never say in their polite "soft no" emails.
